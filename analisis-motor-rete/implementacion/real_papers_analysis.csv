While colorimetric sensors provide a user-friendly, equipment-free approach with visible feedback, their clinical adoption is hindered by limited scalability, poor integration with commercial dressings, and susceptibility to interference from wound exudates-factors that have largely confined existing systems to laboratory research and prevented their practical use in clinical settings. Here, the first roll-to-roll production of smart dressings at a large scale and high throughput, with colorimetric sensors for real-time and historical wound monitoring is presented. This method enables high-throughput production, achieving over 10 impressions per minute on formats up to 50 cm × 50 cm, using biocompatible inks for precise multi-layer printing. In situ testing on a 14-day mouse wound model demonstrates their ability to detect early signs of infection, validating their functionality in physiologically relevant conditions.

As single-layer nanofibers cannot meet different wound surface needs, multifunctional nanofibers with drug combinations surpass the limitation of conventional drug-polymer combinations. Traditional wound therapies have several limitations, prompting the search for more effective alternatives, particularly for chronic wounds. Singlelayer nanofibers often fail to meet diverse wound-healing needs, whereas multifunctional nanofibers, incorporating drug combinations, overcome these limitations. Polymers, widely used in nanofiber formulations, exhibit immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, enhancing the woundhealing process. However, due to a lack of certain biological properties, researchers have formed hybrid polymers, which are a combination of natural and synthetic polymers to meet wound healing requirements. Despite their advantages in biocompatibility and tunable mechanical properties, the clinical translation of polymer-based nanofibers faces challenges in regulatory approval and largescale production. Most studies are still limited to in vitro evaluations, and standardized in vivo models or human trials are necessary to validate their long-term efficacy. Additionally, to meet FDA and DRAP guidelines, these materials must undergo rigorous biodegradation and cytotoxicity assessments before clinical adoption. Owing to several bioactive components (e.g., vitamins, polyphenols) in structures of herbal extract, they have excellent anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. Nanofibrous scaffolds of herbal extracts are in prominence and can have a multi-target synergistic impact. Among several treatments for repairing wounds, growth factors have also been proven as an effective treatment for active healing. This review will provide the researchers with a holistic view of recently reported novel multifunctional nanofibers composed of different combinations of drugs, polymers, herbal extracts, growth factors, and biomolecules to promote wound healing. Although several multifunctional nanofibers have been prepared and shown excellent properties for wound healing therapy, still development of multifunctional nanofibers still needs to be focused on. In a nutshell, multifunctional nanofibers have become very famous in the wound healing process, and a better scale-up of these nanofibers in the coming era will result in commercialization, and products of these nanofibers will become more popular.",PubMed,0,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,none,4.0

The impact of such wounds is felt worldwide, posing a considerable clinical, environmental and socioeconomic challenge and impacting the quality of life. The increasing complexity of care requires a holistic approach, along with extensive knowledge and skills. The challenge experienced by health-care professionals is particularly significant for newly graduate nurses, who face a gap between theory and practice. Digital tools, such as mobile applications, can support wound care by facilitating more precise assessments, early treatment, complication prevention and better outcomes. They also aid in clinical decision-making and improve healthcare delivery in remote areas. Several mobile applications have emerged to enhance wound care. However, there are no applications dedicated to newly graduate nurses. The aim of this study was to co-create and evaluate an algorithm for the development of a wound care mobile application supporting clinical decisions for new graduate nurses. The development of this mobile application is envisioned to improve knowledge application and facilitate evidence-based practice. This study is part of a multiphase project that adopted a pragmatic epistemological approach, using the 'Knowledge-to-Action' conceptual model and Duchscher's Stages of Transition Theory. Following a scoping review, an expert consensus, and stakeholder meetings, this study was pursued through a sequential exploratory mixed methods design carried out in two phases. In the initial phase, 21 participants engaged in semi-structured focus groups to explore their needs regarding clinical decision support in wound care, explore their perceptions of the future mobile application's content and identify and categorize essential components. Through descriptive analysis, five overarching themes emerged, serving as guiding principles for conceptual data model development and refinement. These findings confirmed the significance of integrating a comprehensive glossary complemented by photos, ensuring compatibility between the mobile application and existing documentation systems, and providing quick access to information to avoid burdening work routines. Subsequently, the algorithm was created from the qualitative data collected. The second phase involved presenting an online SurveyMonkey® questionnaire to 34 participants who were not part of the initial phase to quantitatively measure the usability of this algorithm among future users. This phase revealed very positive feedback regarding the usability [score of 6.33 (±0.19) on a scale of 1-7], which reinforces its quality.

The validated Wound-QoL questionnaire allows assessing the impact of chronic wounds on different aspects of HRQoL including physical, psychological, and everyday life-related impairments. The aim of our study was to investigate associations of these HRQoL dimensions with age, sex, and particularly wound genesis. In this retrospective, cross-sectional, multicentre study, Wound-QoL questionnaires from clinical routine of patients with venous leg ulcers, arterial leg ulcers, mixed leg ulcers, and diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) were evaluated. Effects of wound genesis, sex, and age were assessed with analysis of variance as well as correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. The completed questionnaires of 381 patients (f = 152/m = 229; mean age 68.9) were included. The wound genesis groups showed significantly different distributions of age and sex. We also found significant differences between those groups in everyday life-related QoL, with the greatest impairments in patients with DFU. Physical QoL scores showed significant differences between men and women depending on diagnosis group: in patients with venous leg ulcers, women had greater impairment of physical QoL than men. Independent of the underlying diagnosis, women had significantly higher scores in the psychological subscale as well as in the Wound-QoL sum scale. Within the subgroup of arterial leg ulcer patients, overall HRQoL sum score was significantly worse in older patients. Regression analyses supported negative effects of DFU diagnosis and female sex on HRQoL. Our data offer evidence that HRQoL shows clinically relevant differences between patients with chronic wounds of different genesis. Moreover, our data revealed that HRQoL is associated with age and sex, which should be considered when treating the patient groups.

Biofilm-based wound therapy has been extensively advocated. However, point-of-care biofilm diagnosis still largely relies on clinical judgment. In this study, we aimed to develop a rapid tool for diagnosing wound biofilm presence by alcian blue staining. First, we sought to optimize alcian blue staining using a colorimetric-based approach to detect the biofilm, specifically targeting polysaccharides in the extracellular polymeric substances. Among examined transfer membranes and cationic detergents at various concentrations, we selected a positively charged nylon transfer membrane for sample loading, and 1% cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) as the blocking solution. After sample loading and blocking, the membrane was immersed in alcian blue solution for staining, followed by immersion in 1% CTAC to decrease background noise. Each step required only 30 seconds, and the whole procedure was completed within a few minutes. In the second part of this study, we enrolled 31 patients with chronic wounds to investigate the predictive validity of biofilm detection for unhealed wounds at a 1-month follow-up visit. Among the 18 cases with positive wound biofilm staining, 15 wounds (83.3%) were not healed at the 1-month follow-up visit. Only three unhealed wounds (30%) produced in negative staining cases. This finding indicates that biofilm infection is associated with poor healing outcome for chronic wounds. Moreover, our staining results correlated well with the clinical microbiological culture assessment (83.9% consistency; 95.2% sensitivity, and 60% specificity). In conclusion, the modified alcian blue staining protocol used here represents a rapid and sensitive procedure for detecting biofilm in chronic wounds. This technique provides a practical point-of-care approach for detection of wound biofilm, the implementation of which may improve clinical outcomes for chronic wound patients.

In survivors of MThBI, HTS and chronic pain or itch are considered one of the greatest unmet challenges of postburn injury care and psychosocial reintegration. Although scarring, itch, and pain have been clinically associated, there are no prospective, multisite studies examining tissue autograft site pain or itch and scar outcomes. The authors collected a representative cohort (n = 56) of MThBI survivors who received autografting within 14 days of injury and evaluated graft-site pain or itch severity (0-10 Numeric Rating Scale) and HTS using a validated scar photograph assessment scale 6 months following MThBI. Given that stress is known to influence wound healing, the authors also assessed the relationship between previous trauma exposure, peritraumatic stress, preburn overall health (SF-12), scarring, and chronic pain or itch severity using Spearman's correlation.

The PAT was translated into Chinese and was evaluated in patients with chronic wounds. Mean PAT scores were compared between various wound types to evaluate the scale's power to differentiate wound severity (PUSH score). There were 154 consecutive patients included in this study. All items were included, and the results of item-domain correlation (r ranged from 0.838 to 0.967) and small-group analysis (critical ratio, p < 0.05) were satisfactory. Furthermore, the Chinese PAT also showed good criterion validity when correlated with the Cardiff wound impact schedule (r = 0.726, p < 0.01). Exploratory factor analysis of these items extracted only two domains instead of the hypothesized three domains: self-perception of behavioral control and decision making (9 items) and emotional responses to perceived control (3 items), explained 82.045% of the variance. Sensitivity was demonstrated between patients with different activity of daily living, wound severity (PUSH score) and wound types. The internal consistency of all scales of the Chinese PAT was consistently high (Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.939 to 0. 965) and split-half reliability was 0.901.

The use of questionnaires for a continuous assessment of QoL and resulting interventions to improve the situation of the individual are an important cornerstone of a guideline-based wound care. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the Wound-QoL questionnaire. Patients with chronic wounds from two different centers were included in the prospective study. All patients completed the Wound-QoL and two other QoL questionnaires (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, EQ-5D, and Freiburg Life Quality Assessment for wounds, FLQA-wk) at baseline and at two more time points (4 and 8 weeks, respectively). Wound status was defined with an anchor question. Two hundred and twenty-seven patients (48.5% women) participated in the study. Mean age was 66.9 years (range 17-96, median 69.5). Indications were venous leg ulcers (40.1%), pyoderma gangraenosum (14.1%), diabetic or ischemic foot ulcers (5.3%), pressure ulcers (2.6%), and other etiologies (30.0%).

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) enhances wound healing through several mechanisms including neovascularization, but research regarding its effect on soft tissue healing in VHR is lacking. We sought to study the effect of cross-linking on PRP-induced neovascularization in a rodent model of bridging VHR. We hypothesized that ADM cross-linking would negatively affect PRP-induced neovessel formation. PRP was extracted and characterized from pooled whole blood. Porcine cross-linked (cADM) and non-cross-linked ADMs (ncADM) were implanted in a rat model of chronic VHR after treatment with saline (control) or PRP. Neovascularization of samples at 2, 4, and 6 weeks was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining of CD 31. Adhesion severity at necropsy was compared using a previously validated scale. Addition of PRP increased neovascularization in both cADM and ncADM at 2- and 4-week time points but appeared to do so in a dependent fashion, with significantly greater neovascularization in the PRP-treated ncADMs compared to cADMs. Omental adhesions were increased in all PRP-treated groups. Results indicate that, for 2-week measurements when compared with the cADM group without PRP therapy, the mean change in neovascularization due to ncADM was 3.27 (Z = 2.75, p = 0.006), PRP was 17.56 (Z = 14.77, p < 0.001), and the combined effect of ncADM and PRP was 9.41 (Z = 5.6, p < 0.001). The 4-week data indicate that the average neovascularization change due to ncADM was 0.676 (Z = 0.7, p = 0.484), PRP was 7.69 (Z = 7.95, p < 0.001), and combined effect of ncADM and PRP was 5.28 (Z = 3.86, p < 0.001). These findings validate PRP as a clinical adjunct to enhance the native tissue response to implantable biomaterials and suggest that ncADM is more amenable than cADM to induced neovascularization.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the concurrent validity, construct validity and predictive validity of DFUAS in Indonesia. A prospective cohort study was conducted on patients with diabetic foot ulcer at Kitamura wound clinic in Indonesia. A total of 62 patients with 70 diabetic foot ulcers were assessed with DFUAS tool, Bates-Jensen wound assessment tool (BWAT), and pressure ulcer scale for healing (PUSH). Concurrent validity was determined by correlation of the DFUAS total score with the external criterion (BWAT, PUSH, and wound surface area).

The comparison of the total DFUAS score with chronic wound status was p < 0.001. The predictive validity test indicated that a DFUAS cutoff score of 12 produced the best balance of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (89%, 71%, 86%, and 77%, respectively).

A multitude of researchers have investigated various natural products with physiological activities, including antioxidant effects, for healing chronic skin wounds. Balloon flower root (BFR), which contains bioactive components such as platycodins, is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this study, we isolated BFR-derived extracellular vesicles (BFR-EVs) that possess anti-inflammatory, proliferative, and antioxidant activities via a combination of polyethylene glycol-based precipitation and ultracentrifugation. Our objective was to investigate the potential of BFR-EVs in treating chronic wounds caused by ROS. Despite efficient intracellular delivery, BFR-EVs showed no significant cytotoxicity. In addition, BFR-EVs inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, water-soluble tetrazolium salt-8 assay showed that BFR-EVs had a proliferation-promoting effect on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Scratch closure and transwell migration assays indicated that BFR-EVs could promote the migration of HDFs. When the antioxidant effect of BFR-EVs was evaluated through 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, the results revealed that BFR-EVs significantly suppressed ROS generation and oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and ultraviolet irradiation.

,,"Antioxidant, Wound Healing Potential and In Silico Assessment of Naringin, Eicosane and Octacosane",Molecules,2023.0,"1. Diabetic chronic wounds, mainly foot ulcers, constitute one of the most common complications of poorly managed diabetes mellitus. The most typical reasons are insufficient glycemic management, latent neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and neglected foot care. In addition, it is a common cause of foot osteomyelitis and amputation of the lower extremities. Patients are admitted in larger numbers attributable to chronic wounds compared to any other diabetic disease. In the United States, diabetes is currently the most common cause of non-traumatic amputations. Approximately five percent of diabetics develop foot ulcers, and one percent require amputation. Therefore, it is necessary to identify sources of lead with wound-healing properties. Redox imbalance due to excessive oxidative stress is one of the causes for the development of diabetic wounds. Antioxidants have been shown to decrease the progression of diabetic neuropathy by scavenging ROS, regenerating endogenous and exogenous antioxidants, and reversing redox imbalance. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play vital roles in numerous phases of the wound healing process. Antioxidant and fibroblast cell migration activity of Marantodes pumilum (MP) crude extract has previously been reported. Through their antioxidant, epithelialization, collagen synthesis, and fibroblast migration activities, the authors hypothesise that naringin, eicosane and octacosane identified in the MP extract may have wound-healing properties. 2. The present study aims to identify the bioactive components present in the dichloromethane (DCM) extract of M. pumilum and evaluate their antioxidant and wound healing activity. Bioactive components were identified using LCMS, HPTLC and GCMS. Excision wound on STZ-induced diabetic rat model, human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cell line and colorimetric antioxidant assays were used to evaluate wound healing and antioxidant activities, respectively. Molecular docking and pkCMS software would be utilised to predict binding energy and affinity, as well as ADME parameters. 3. Naringin (NAR), eicosane (EIC), and octacosane (OCT) present in MP displayed antioxidant action and wound excision closure. Histological examination HDF cell line demonstrates epithelialization, collagen production, fibroblast migration, polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration (PNML), and fibroblast movement. The results of molecular docking indicate a substantial attraction and contact between MMPs. pkCMS prediction indicates inadequate blood-brain barrier permeability, low toxicity, and absence of hepatotoxicity. 4. Wound healing properties of (NEO) naringin, eicosane and octacosane may be the result of their antioxidant properties and possible interactions with MMP.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0
,,Updates on Recent Clinical Assessment of Commercial Chronic Wound Care Products,Advanced Healthcare Materials,2023.0,"Impaired wound healing after trauma, disorders, and surgeries impact millions of people globally every year. Dysregulation in orchestrated healing mechanisms and underlying medical complications make chronic wound management extremely challenging. Besides standard‐of‐care treatments including broad spectrum antibiotics and wound‐debridement, novel adjuvant therapies are clinically tested and commercialized. These include topical agents, skin substitutes, growth factor delivery, and stem cell therapies. With a goal to overcome factors playing pivotal role in delayed wound healing, researchers are exploring novel approaches to elicit desirable healing outcomes in chronic wounds. Although recent innovations in wound care products, therapies, and devices are extensively reviewed in past, a comprehensive review summarizing their clinical outcomes is surprisingly lacking. Herein, this work reviews the commercially available wound care products and their performance in clinical trials to provide a statistically comprehensive understanding of their safety and efficacy. The performance and suitability of various commercial wound care platforms, including xenogeneic and allogenic products, wound care devices, and novel biomaterials, are discussed for chronic wounds.

,,Analysis of therapeutic effect of silver‐based dressings on chronic wound healing,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"Chronic wounds are susceptible to bacterial infections and at high risk of developing antibiotic‐resistant bacterial infections. Silver is an antimicrobial by targeting almost all types of bacteria in chronic wounds to reduce the bacterial load in the infected area and further facilitate the healing process. This study focused on exploring whether silver‐based dressings were superior to non‐silver dressings in the treatment of chronic wounds. PubMed, Web of Science and Embase were comprehensively searched from inception to March 2024 for randomized clinical trials and observational studies. The endpoints in terms of wound healing rate, complete healing time, reduction on wound surface area and wound infection rate were analysed using Review Manager 5.4 software. A total of 15 studies involving 5046 patients were eventually included. The results showed that compared with patients provided with non‐silver dressings, patients provided with silver‐based dressings had higher wound healing rate (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.10–1.85, p = 0.008), shorter complete healing time (MD: −0.96, 95% CI: −1.08 ~ −0.85, p < 0.00001) and lower wound infection rate (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40–0.79, p = 0.001); no significant difference in the reduction on wound surface area (MD: 12.41, 95% CI: −19.59–44.40, p = 0.45) was found. These findings suggested that the silver‐based dressings were able to enhance chronic wound healing rate, shorten the complete healing time and reduce wound infection rate, but had no significant improvement in the reduction on wound surface area. Large‐scale and rigorous studies are required to confirm the beneficial effects of silver‐based dressings on chronic wound healing.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,6,9,0,0,True,False,False,False,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,antimicrobial,25.0

,,Multi‐drug resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis from chronic wounds impair healing in human wound model,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2024.0,"Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) represent one of the most prevalent types of chronic wounds characterised by perturbed microbiome and biofilm‐forming bacteria. As one of the most abundant skin‐commensal, Staphylococcus epidermidis is known as beneficial for the host, however, some strains can form biofilms and hinder wound healing. In this study, S. epidermidis distribution in VLUs and associated resistome were analysed in ulcer tissue from patients. Virulence of S. epidermidis isolates from VLUs were evaluated by whole genome sequencing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, in vitro biofilm and binding assays, and assessment of biofilm‐forming capability and pro‐inflammatory potential using human ex vivo wound model. We demonstrated that S. epidermidis isolates from VLUs inhibit re‐epithelialization through biofilm‐dependent induction of IL‐1β, IL‐8, and IL‐6 which was in accordance with impaired healing outcomes observed in patients. High extracellular matrix binding ability of VLU isolates was associated with antimicrobial resistance and expression levels of the embp and sdrG, responsible for bacterial binding to fibrinogen and fibrin, respectively.

,,Bioimpedance sensor array for monitoring chronic wounds: Validation of method feasibility,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"In an ageing society, the incidence of hard‐to‐heal wounds is rising. Chronic wound healing is a complex process, which requires specialised treatment. Clinical assessment of the wound is essential to establish care approaches but is usually based on visual evaluation and it remains challenging. Therefore, innovative quantitative methods for the assessment of chronic wounds are needed. We conducted a single‐centre observational study designed to assess the feasibility of a bioimpedance measurement method conducted with a multielectrode sensor array to monitor the wound healing process in patients with chronic wounds of venous, mixed venous–arterial and diabetic aetiology. In total, 104 measurements of bioimpedance were conducted in 18 ulcers during the study. Across all 7 patients analysed, the bioimpedance of the ulcers was consistently increasing as the wound surface was decreasing. The variables had significant (p < 0.001) and strong negative correlation (r = −0.86). We validated the feasibility of the bioimpedance measurement method for the monitoring of the wound healing process on the lower legs. It may be a promising quantitative method for monitoring the status of the wounds.

,,Dielectrophoresis Prototypic Polystyrene Particle Synchronization toward Alive Keratinocyte Cells for Rapid Chronic Wound Healing,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2021.0,"Diabetes patients are at risk of having chronic wounds, which would take months to years to resolve naturally. Chronic wounds can be countered using the electrical stimulation technique (EST) by dielectrophoresis (DEP), which is label-free, highly sensitive, and selective for particle trajectory. In this study, we focus on the validation of polystyrene particles of 3.2 and 4.8 μm to predict the behavior of keratinocytes to estimate their crossover frequency (fXO) using the DEP force (FDEP) for particle manipulation. MyDEP is a piece of java-based stand-alone software used to consider the dielectric particle response to AC electric fields and analyzes the electrical properties of biological cells. The prototypic 3.2 and 4.8 μm polystyrene particles have fXO values from MyDEP of 425.02 and 275.37 kHz, respectively. Fibroblast cells were also subjected to numerical analysis because the interaction of keratinocytes and fibroblast cells is essential for wound healing. Consequently, the predicted fXO from the MyDEP plot for keratinocyte and fibroblast cells are 510.53 and 28.10 MHz, respectively. The finite element method (FEM) is utilized to compute the electric field intensity and particle trajectory based on DEP and drag forces. Moreover, the particle trajectories are quantified in a high and low conductive medium. To justify the simulation, further DEP experiments are carried out by applying a non-uniform electric field to a mixture of different sizes of polystyrene particles and keratinocyte cells, and these results are well agreed. The alive keratinocyte cells exhibit NDEP force in a highly conductive medium from 100 kHz to 25 MHz. 2D/3D motion analysis software (DIPP-MotionV) can also perform image analysis of keratinocyte cells and evaluate the average speed, acceleration, and trajectory position. The resultant NDEP force can align the keratinocyte cells in the wound site upon suitable applied frequency. Thus, MyDEP estimates the Clausius–Mossotti factors (CMF), FEM computes the cell trajectory, and the experimental results of prototypic polystyrene particles are well correlated and provide an optimistic response towards keratinocyte cells for rapid wound healing applications.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,9.0
,,Chronic Wound Healing Assessment System Based on Different Features Modalities and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) Feature Reduction,IEEE Access,2019.0,"Identification and treatment of chronic wounds (CWs) are considered economic and social challenges, especially with respect to bedridden and elderly persons. CWs do not follow a predictive course of healing within a particular period. Their treatment and management costs are very high. Also, CWs decrease quality of life for patients, which cause severe pain and discomfort. In this paper, we proposed a comprehensive wound healing assessment framework based on current appearance, texture, and prior visual appearance analysis to handle different types of CWs depending on extracting various tissue types. The framework provided an accurate evaluation tool for the CW healing process depending on extracting and fusing significant features from the CWs RGB images. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to retrieve the most significant features to reduce computation time. The gradient boosted trees (GBT) classifier was used to classify different tissue types. Finally, the healing assessment of the CWs depended on calculating the improvement in the area of the necrotic eschar, slough, granulation, and healing epithelial tissues. The framework was trained and tested using 377 RGB images from Medetec wound database and national pressure ulcer advisory panel website. The proposed system achieved an average accuracy of 96% for tissue classification, which helps in obtaining an accurate CW healing assessment.

PRO-F can be activated by light without consuming endogenous substances and the accompanying fluorescent signal makes the real-time tracking of released H2S possible. PRO-F is able to deliver H2S in an intracellular environment with moderate release efficiency (50%), which presents cytoprotective effects against excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced damage.

,,Towards an AI-Based Objective Prognostic Model for Quantifying Wound Healing,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,2023.0,"Chronic wounds affect millions of people worldwide every year. An adequate assessment of a wound's prognosis is critical to wound care, guiding clinical decision making by helping clinicians understand wound healing status, severity, triaging and determining the efficacy of a treatment regimen. The current standard of care involves using wound assessment tools, such as Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) and Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT), to determine wound prognosis. However, these tools involve manual assessment of a multitude of wound characteristics and skilled consideration of a variety of factors, thus, making wound prognosis a slow process which is prone to misinterpretation and high degree of variability. Therefore, in this work we have explored the viability of replacing subjective clinical information with deep learning-based objective features derived from wound images, pertaining to wound area and tissue amounts. These objective features were used to train prognostic models that quantified the risk of delayed wound healing, using a dataset consisting of 2.1 million wound evaluations derived from more than 200,000 wounds. The objective model, which was trained exclusively using image-based objective features, achieved at minimum a 5% and 9% improvement over PUSH and BWAT, respectively. Our best performing model, that used both subjective and objective features, achieved at minimum an 8% and 13% improvement over PUSH and BWAT, respectively. Moreover, the reported models consistently outperformed the standard tools across various clinical settings, wound etiologies, sexes, age groups and wound ages, thus establishing the generalizability of the models.",Semantic Scholar,5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,wound_assessment,none,12.0
,,Ethnopharmacological Survey on Medicinal Plants Used by Traditional Healers in Central and Kara Regions of Togo for Antitumor and Chronic Wound Healing Effects,Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine,2020.0,"Cancer is an emerging public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Several medicinal plants are used by traditional healers to treat tumors. In Togo, there are no recorded data for these plants but traditional healers claim to cure tumors with some success. So, information on medicinal plants used to cure human tumors and cancer could be of great importance for their widespread use and scientific validation. The present ethnopharmacological survey aims to record information on antitumor plants in central and Kara regions of Togo. Semistructured validated questionnaires were administered to fifty-seven traditional healers specialized in tumor management in 7 prefectures of Togo. Good practices and know-how were recorded.

,,"First‐in‐human clinical trial of allogeneic, platelet‐derived extracellular vesicles as a potential therapeutic for delayed wound healing",Journal of Extracellular Vesicles,2023.0,"Abstract The release of growth factors, cytokines and extracellular matrix modifiers by activated platelets is an important step in the process of healthy wound healing. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by activated platelets carry this bioactive cargo in an enriched form, and may therefore represent a potential therapeutic for the treatment of delayed wound healing, such as chronic wounds. While EVs show great promise in regenerative medicine, their production at clinical scale remains a critical challenge and their tolerability in humans is still to be fully established. In this work, we demonstrate that Ligand‐based Exosome Affinity Purification (LEAP) chromatography can successfully isolate platelet EVs (pEVs) of clinical grade from activated platelets, which retain the regenerative properties of the parent cell. LEAP‐isolated pEVs display the expected biophysical features of EV populations and transport essential proteins in wound healing processes, including insulin growth factor (IGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF‐ß). In vitro studies show that pEVs induce proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts and increase dermal endothelial cells' angiogenic potential, demonstrating their wound healing potential. pEV treatment activates the ERK and Akt signalling pathways within recipient cells. In a first‐in‐human, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase I clinical trial of healthy volunteer adults, designed primarily to assess safety in the context of wound healing, we demonstrate that injections of LEAP‐purified pEVs in formulation buffer are safe and well tolerated (Plexoval II study, ACTRN12620000944932). As a secondary objective, biological activity in the context of wound healing rate was assessed. In this cohort of healthy participants, in which the wound bed would not be expected to be deficient in the bioactive cargo that pEVs carry, all wounds healed rapidly and completely and no difference in time to wound closure of the treated and untreated wounds was observed at the single dose tested. The outcomes of this study evidence that pEVs manufactured through the LEAP process can be injected safely in humans as a potential wound healing treatment, and warrant further study in clinical trials designed expressly to assess therapeutic efficacy in patients with delayed or disrupted wound healing.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,5.0

The gene expression profiles of psoriatic, wound and chronic ulcer patients, as well as healthy controls, were determined via RNA extraction and next‐generation sequencing of biopsies. In order to identify biomarkers, functional enrichment, differential expression analysis and machine learning algorithms were implemented. It is worth mentioning that the genes IL17A, TNF, KRT16, MMP9, and CD44 exhibited substantial correlations with the pathogenesis of the conditions being studied. As evidenced by their AUC‐ROC values approaching 0.90, machine learning models accurately identified these biomarkers. The differential gene expression was consequently validated via qRT‐PCR, which highlighted the increased expression of matrix remodelling enzymes and inflammatory cytokines.

,,Systematic review and quality assessment of clinical and economic evidence for superabsorbent wound dressings in a population with chronic ulcers,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"Effective exudate management is key for optimal ulcer healing. Superabsorbent dressings are designed to have high fluid handling capacity, reduced risk of exudate leakage, fluid retention under compression, and to sequester harmful exudate components. This study aimed to systematically identify existing evidence for the clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of superabsorbent dressings for the treatment of moderate‐to‐highly exudating chronic ulcers of various etiologies. The aim is focused on examining the ‘class’ effect of all superabsorbers, not any particular dressing. Clinical and cost effectiveness systematic reviews were conducted, searching Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The Cost Effectiveness Analysis Registry and Econ papers were also searched for the economic review. Outcomes of interest included ulcer closure, dressing properties, hospital‐ and infection‐related outcomes, safety, and economic outcomes. Fourteen studies were included in the clinical systematic review. Eleven were case series, with one randomised controlled trial, one retrospective matched observational study, and one retrospective cohort study. The studies investigated eight superabsorbent dressings and were heterogeneous in their patient population and outcomes. Superabsorbent dressings may result in favourable outcomes, including reductions in frequency of dressing change and pain scores. As most studies were case series, drawing firm conclusions was difficult due to absence of a comparator arm. The economic systematic review identified seven studies, five of which were cost‐utility analyses. These suggested superabsorbent dressings are a more cost‐effective option for the treatment of chronic ulcers compared with standard dressings.

Patient information included DNA sequencing‐based wound microbiome clinical reports corresponding to the initial clinical visit. Wound microbiome data was integrated into the SEM as a latent variable using a pre‐modelling parcel optimization routine presented herein for the first time (available as R library parcelR). A microbiome latent construct associated with improved healing was validated, and the final SEM included this latent construct plus three species associated with diminished healing (Anaerococcus vaginalis, Finegoldia magna and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as smoking, wound volume, slough, exudate, edema, percent granulation and wound etiology. This model explained 46% of variations in healing time, with the microbiome contributing the largest proportion of variance explained. Model validity was confirmed with an independent cohort (n = 79) through which ~60% of the variation in healing time was predicted.

,,Vaccarin Regulates Diabetic Chronic Wound Healing through FOXP2/AGGF1 Pathways,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2020.0,"Background: Diabetes mellitus is a growing global health issue nearly across the world. Diabetic patients who are prone to develop diabetes-related complications often exhibit progressive neuropathy (painless and sensory loss). It is usual for small wounds to progress to ulceration, which especially worsens with peripheral arterial disease and in the presence of anaerobic bacteria, culminating into gangrene. In our study, vaccarin (VAC), the main active monomer extracted from Chinese herb vaccariae semen, is proven to have a role in promoting diabetic chronic wound healing through a cytoprotective role under high glucose conditions. Materials and methods: We constructed a pressure ulcer on both VAC-treated and control mice based on a type 1 diabetes (T1DM) model. The wound healing index was evaluated by an experimental wound assessment tool (EWAT). We also determined the effect of VAC on the proliferation and cell migration of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) by a cell counting kit (CCK-8), a scratch and transwell assay. Results: The results demonstrated that VAC could promote the proliferation and migration of high glucose-stimulated HMEC-1 cells, which depend on the activation of FOXP2/AGGF1. Activation of the angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) caused enhanced phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase (Akt) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (Erk1/2). By silencing the expression of forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) protein by siRNA, both mRNA and protein expression of AGGF1 were downregulated, leading to a decreased proliferation and migration of HMEC-1 cells. In addition, a diabetic chronic wound model in vivo unveiled that VAC had a positive effect on chronic wound healing, which involved the activation of the above-mentioned pathways.

,,A meta‐analysis on the impact of spinal cord stimulation on post‐operative wound healing in patients with multiple sclerosis,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as a potential therapeutic tool for various chronic conditions, but its efficacy in post‐operative wound healing for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has not been comprehensively understood. This meta‐analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of SCS on post‐operative wound healing and scar formation in MS patients. A systematic literature review identified seven studies for inclusion. We focused on wound healing as measured by the redness, edema, ecchymosis, discharge, approximation (REEDA) scale 1 week post‐operation and scar formation assessed by the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) 3 months post‐operation. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in wound healing in the SCS group, with a standard mean difference (SMD) of −5.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [−7.56, −4.09], p < 0.01) on the REEDA scale. For scar formation, the SCS group showed a notable reduction in MSS scores, with an SMD of −10.06 (95% CI: [−14.53, −5.58], p < 0.01). These findings underscore the potential of SCS as an adjunct therapy in enhancing surgical recovery in MS patients, pointing towards its broader applications in post‐operative care.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,4.0
,,Microvascular fragment-loaded platelet-rich plasma dressing promotes cutaneous wound healing.,Advances in wound care,2024.0,"OBJECTIVE
Chronic wounds represent a considerable burden for the affected patients and the healthcare system. To overcome this problem, effective treatment strategies are urgently required. In this study, we tested a novel approach by combining platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and microvascular fragments (MVF) to create a prevascularized gel dressing.


APPROACH
MVF were enzymatically isolated from the epididymal fat pads of transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ C57BL/6J donor mice. Subsequently, 5,000 MVF were suspended in 10 µL murine PRP as carrier and transferred into full-thickness skin wounds within dorsal skinfold chambers of C57BL/6J wild-type mice (PRP+MVF). Wound healing in comparison to empty wounds (control) and wounds filled with PRP alone was repeatedly analyzed throughout 14 days by means of stereomicroscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
Planimetric assessment of the wound size over time revealed a significantly accelerated and improved healing of PRP+MVF-treated wounds when compared to PRP-treated and empty control wounds. These wounds also exhibited a significantly higher density of blood and lymph vessels, which originated from the GFP+ MVF isolates and effectively promoted granulation tissue formation inside the skin defects.


INNOVATION
This study is the first to combine PRP and MVF for the improvement of wound healing.


CONCLUSION
The combination of PRP and MVF represents a promising approach for the future treatment of wounds that do not heal spontaneously due to poor wound healing conditions.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0
,,"Beyond the Species Barrier: A Systematic Review and Risk of Bias Assessment on the Efficacy, Safety, and Translational Potential of Xenogenic Platelet-Rich Plasma for Wound Healing",Bioscientia Medicina : Journal of Biomedicine and Translational Research,2025.0,"Background: Chronic wounds represent a significant clinical burden. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an effective but patient-limited therapy. Xenogenic PRP (xPRP), derived from animal sources, offers a potential off-the-shelf, scalable alternative. This review synthesizes the current preclinical and early clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of xPRP for wound healing. 
Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar up to July 2025, with no publication date restrictions, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies evaluating xPRP on wound healing outcomes in in vivo, in vitro, or ex vivo models were included. Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using the SYRCLE tool for animal studies and a modified QUIN tool for in vitro studies. Data were synthesized narratively due to heterogeneity. 
Results: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising ten animal and three in vitro investigations (two studies reported both components). Evidence from porcine, bovine, and deer xPRP sources consistently demonstrated significant improvements in wound closure rates, re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition compared to saline controls. Porcine xPRP, for instance, accelerated wound closure by up to 45% over controls in diabetic rodent models. However, when compared to autologous PRP, xPRP generally showed slightly inferior, though still positive, outcomes. Immunogenic responses were minimal and localized, with no systemic adverse events reported. Risk of bias assessment revealed that while most studies had clear objectives, many were at high risk of bias due to a lack of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinded outcome assessment. 
Conclusion: Xenogenic PRP demonstrates considerable promise as a bioactive therapeutic for wound healing, promoting key regenerative processes with a reassuring preliminary safety profile. However, the current evidence base is limited by methodological inconsistencies and a high risk of bias. Future research must prioritize standardized preparation protocols and methodologically rigorous, large-animal and human clinical trials to validate its translational potential.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0

The aim was to assess and compare the effect of Curcumin gel (Curenext) and noneugenol periodontal dressing (Coe pak) on tissue response, wound healing in the early stages, and pain post periodontal flap surgery in patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients requiring periodontal flap surgery were allotted to two groups at random, one receiving periodontal dressing and the other receiving curcumin for this cross over split-mouth study. Flap surgeries were performed on 2 quadrants with 3 weeks' interval. After suture removal, postoperative sites were assessed for tissue response (tissue color [TC] and tissue edema [TE]) and early wound healing as primary outcomes of the study. The secondary outcome was pain assessment and the number of analgesics taken by the individuals. Results: The two groups showed no significant differences with respect to tissue response, early wound healing, and pain perception. Curcumin group consumed lesser number of analgesics as compared to the one with periodontal dressing. Conclusion: It was confirmed that periodontal dressing and curcumin are effective in reducing the TE, normalizing the TC, enhancing the wound healing and reducing the pain perception.

,,The Role of Cold Atmospheric Plasma in Wound Healing Processes in Critically Ill Patients,Journal of Personalized Medicine,2023.0,"Critically ill patients are at risk of skin wounds, which reduce their quality of life, complicate their pharmacological regimens, and prolong their hospital stays in intensive care units (ICUs), while also increasing overall mortality and morbidity rates. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has been proposed as a viable option for many biological and medical applications, given its capacity to reduce wound bacterial contamination and promote wound healing. The aim of this narrative review is to describe how CAP works and its operating mechanisms, as well as reporting its possible applications in critical care settings. The success of CAP in the treatment of wounds, in particular, bedsores or pressure sores, presents an innovative path in the prevention of nosocomial infections and an opportunity of reducing the negative implications of these diseases for the NHS. This narrative review of the literature was conducted following the ‘Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles’ (SANRA) methodology. Previous literature highlights three biological effects of plasma: inactivation of a wide range of microorganisms, including those that are multi-drug-resistant; increased cell proliferation and angiogenesis with a shorter period of plasma treatment; and apoptosis stimulation with a longer and more intensive treatment. CAP is effective in many areas of the medical field, with no significant adverse effects on healthy cells. However, its use can produce potentially serious side effects and should, therefore, be used under expert supervision and in appropriate doses.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0
,,Assessment of Wound-Related Pain Experiences of Patients With Chronic Wounds,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs.,2024.0,"PURPOSE: The primary aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of wound-related pain (WRP) in patients with chronic wounds and assess the use of pain relief measures. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: A convenience sample of patients with chronic wounds was recruited from outpatient clinics of 12 hospitals covering 7 of 13 cities in the Jiangsu province located in eastern China from July 10 to August 25, 2020. The sample comprised 451 respondents, and their mean age was 54.85 (SD 19.16) years; 56.1% (253/451) patients were male. METHODS: An investigator-designed questionnaire was used to collect pain-related information from patients. The questionnaire consisted of 4 parts: (1) basic demographic and clinical information (patient and wound characteristics); (2) wound baseline pain; (3) wound-related procedural pain and pain relief method; and (4) the effect of WRP on the patient. Pain was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scored from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). Severity of pain was based on NRS scores' classification as mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), and severe (7-10). The survey was conducted from July 10 to August 25, 2020. Participants were instructed on use of the NRS and then completed the questionnaire following dressing change independently. RESULTS: The 3 most common types of chronic wounds were traumatic ulcers, surgical wounds, and venous leg ulcers. The 3 most prevalent locations were lower limbs, feet, and thorax/abdomen. Of all patients, 62.5% (282/451) and 93.8% (423/451) patients experienced wound baseline pain and wound-related procedural pain, respectively. The mean score of wound baseline pain was 3.76 (SD 1.60) indicating moderate pain. During wound management, the highest pain score was 6.45 (SD 2.75) indicating severe pain; the most severe pain scores were associated with debridement. The use of drugs to relieve wound pain was low, while the use of nondrug-based analgesia was relatively high. Because of WRP, patients with chronic wounds feared dressing changes, hesitated to move, and showed a decline in sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Wound baseline pain and wound-related procedural pain were very common in patients with chronic wounds. In the future, targeted intervention plans should be developed by combining drug-based and nondrug-based analgesia according to pain severity.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,general,none,2.0
,,Meta‐analysis comparing different ultrasound detection methods to accurately assess wound healing and scar formation after caesarean section,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"The accurate assessment of wound healing post‐caesarean section, especially in twin pregnancies, remains a pivotal concern in obstetrics, given its implications for maternal health and recovery. Traditional methods, including conventional abdominal ultrasonography (CU), have been challenged by the advent of transvaginal ultrasonography (TU), offering potentially enhanced sensitivity and specificity. This meta‐analysis directly compares the efficacy of TU and CU in evaluating wound healing and scar formation, crucial for optimizing postoperative care. Results indicate that TU is associated with significantly better outcomes in wound healing, demonstrated by lower REEDA scores (SMD = −20.56, 95% CI: [−27.34.20, −13.77], p < 0.01), and in scar formation reduction, evidenced by lower Manchester Scar Scale scores (SMD = −25.18, 95% CI: [−29.98, −20.39], p < 0.01).

,,Efficacy of Topical Wound Oxygen Therapy in Healing Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcers: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Advances in Wound Care,2022.0,"Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that employed the use of topical oxygen therapy (TOT) as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of Wagner 1 and 2 diabetic foot ulcers. Approach: Following a literature search of eligible studies from 2010 onward, four RCTs were included. Studies were analyzed for patient and wound characteristics, outcomes, risk of bias, and quality of the evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A random-effects meta-analysis for complete wound healing was carried out due to statistical heterogeneity of included studies. Results: Risk of bias judgment (RoB2 analysis) resulted in one low-risk trial and three trials with some risk. One study was determined to be the origin of the statistical heterogeneity. Pooled results showed statistical significance with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–2.37; p = 0.021). Sensitivity analysis, based on imputed values for missing outcomes, demonstrated that both the RR and 95% CIs changed little. The GRADE ratings for each domain were as follows: (a) risk of bias: moderate (3); (b) imprecision: moderate (2), high (1); (c) inconsistency: low (2), high (1); (d) indirectness: moderate (2), high (1); and (e) publication bias: moderate (1), high (2).

,,The Use of Silver Oxynitrate Wound Dressings in the Treatment of Chronic Wounds: A Feasibility Pilot Study,Advances in Skin & Wound Care,2024.0,"ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a silver oxynitrate (Ag7NO11) dressing on wound healing in patients with stalled chronic wounds. METHODS A prospective pilot study was conducted to determine the feasibility and effect of using silver oxynitrate dressings within an outpatient setting in Alberta, Canada. A total of 23 patients (12 women and 11 men; mean age, 66.1 ± 13.8 years) with a chronic wound that failed to heal with conventional treatment were included in the study. Wound assessments including the Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool, wound-related pain, wound size, and patient quality of life (QoL) were conducted at baseline, after dressing application for 1 and 2 weeks, and during 4- and 12-week follow-ups. RESULTS Dressing application at 1 and 2 weeks improved patients’ wound healing progression as measured through significantly decreased Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool scores with a more than 10% decrease at 4- and 12-week follow-up (P < .001). Pain (P = .004), and QoL psyche subscore (P = .008) significantly improved at 4-week follow-ups, although wound area, perimeter, and QoL body and everyday subscores were not significantly affected. Wound size was not significantly affected. CONCLUSIONS The silver oxynitrate dressing may improve healing progression in patients with chronic wounds, enhance patient experience by reducing wound-related pain, and improve patients’ mental well-being. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the effect of silver oxynitrate dressings on wound area, perimeter, and volume measurements.",Semantic Scholar,2,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,wound_assessment,11.0
,,Integrated network pharmacology and experimental validation to explore the mechanisms underlying naringenin treatment of chronic wounds,Scientific Reports,2023.0,"Naringenin is a citrus flavonoid with various biological functions and a potential therapeutic agent for skin diseases, such as UV radiation and atopic dermatitis. The present study investigates the therapeutic effect and pharmacological mechanism of naringenin on chronic wounds. Using network pharmacology, we identified 163 potential targets and 12 key targets of naringenin. Oxidative stress was confirmed to be the main biological process modulated by naringenin. The transcription factor p65 ( RELA ), alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase ( AKT1 ), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( MAPK1 ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 ( MAPK3 ) were identified as common targets of multiple pathways involved in treating chronic wounds. Molecular docking verified that these four targets stably bound naringenin. Naringenin promoted wound healing in mice in vivo by inhibiting wound inflammation. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that a low naringenin concentration did not significantly affect normal skin cell viability and cell apoptosis; a high naringenin concentration was cytotoxic and reduced cell survival by promoting apoptosis. Meanwhile, comprehensive network pharmacology, molecular docking and in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that naringenin could treat chronic wounds by alleviating oxidative stress and reducing the inflammatory response. The underlying mechanism of naringenin in chronic wound therapy involved modulating the RELA, AKT1 and MAPK1/3 signalling pathways to inhibit ROS production and inflammatory cytokine expression.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,9.0
,,Therapeutic efficacy of platelet‐rich fibrin on surgical site wound healing in patients undergoing oral carcinoma resection: A meta‐analysis,International Wound Journal,2023.0,"Oral carcinoma, a prevalent malignancy of the oral cavity, often results in surgical site wounds post‐resection.

,,The effectiveness of negative-pressure wound therapy for wound healing after stoma reversal: a randomized control study,Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research,2023.0,"Purpose The purse-string closure (PSC) method is used for skin closure after stoma reversal to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs). However, PSC requires a longer healing period than primary closure. The application of negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) may reduce the healing period of many wound types. This study aimed to investigate whether the application of NPWT promotes wound healing after the PSC method for stoma reversal. Methods This study was a randomized controlled study. Patients who had undergone stoma reversal surgery were randomized to receive NPWT or simple dressing after surgery. The primary outcome was a complete wound-healing period. We also investigated SSI, hospital stay, total cost, and the patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS) as secondary outcomes. Results A total of 36 patients were randomized into 2 groups. The median wound healing period was shorter in the NPWT group than in the control group (17.5 days [range, 11–24 days] vs. 21.5 days [range, 14–41 days], P = 0.006). SSI rate and hospital stay did not differ between the groups. However, the number of dressings was lower in the NPWT group than in the control group (5 [range, 3–7] vs. 17 [range, 10–30], P < 0.001). The total cost for dressing was comparable between the groups. The POSAS was not different between the groups.

,,Extracellular matrix-inspired biomaterials for wound healing,Molecular Biology Reports,2024.0,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a debilitating and life-threatening complication of Diabetes Mellitus. Ulceration develops from a combination of associated diabetic complications, including neuropathy, circulatory dysfunction, and repetitive trauma, and they affect approximately 19–34% of patients as a result. The severity and chronic nature of diabetic foot ulcers stems from the disruption to normal wound healing, as a result of the molecular mechanisms which underly diabetic pathophysiology. The current standard-of-care is clinically insufficient to promote healing for many DFU patients, resulting in a high frequency of recurrence and limb amputations. Biomaterial dressings, and in particular those derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM), have emerged as a promising approach for the treatment of DFU. By providing a template for cell infiltration and skin regeneration, ECM-derived biomaterials offer great hope as a treatment for DFU. A range of approaches exist for the development of ECM-derived biomaterials, including the use of purified ECM components, decellularisation and processing of donor/ animal tissues, or the use of in vitro-deposited ECM. This review discusses the development and assessment of ECM-derived biomaterials for the treatment of chronic wounds, as well as the mechanisms of action through which ECM-derived biomaterials stimulate wound healing.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0
,,Chronic Wound Image Augmentation and Assessment Using Semi-Supervised Progressive Multi-Granularity EfficientNet,IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,2023.0,"Goal: Augment a small, imbalanced, wound dataset by using semi-supervised learning with a secondary dataset. Then utilize the augmented wound dataset for deep learning-based wound assessment. Methods: The clinically-validated Photographic Wound Assessment Tool (PWAT) scores eight wound attributes: Size, Depth, Necrotic Tissue Type, Necrotic Tissue Amount, Granulation Tissue type, Granulation Tissue Amount, Edges, Periulcer Skin Viability to comprehensively assess chronic wound images. A small corpus of 1639 wound images labeled with ground truth PWAT scores was used as reference. A Semi-Supervised learning and Progressive Multi-Granularity training mechanism were used to leverage a secondary corpus of 9870 unlabeled wound images. Wound scoring utilized the EfficientNet Convolutional Neural Network on the augmented wound corpus. Results: Our proposed Semi-Supervised PMG EfficientNet (SS-PMG-EfficientNet) approach estimated all 8 PWAT sub-scores with classification accuracies and F1 scores of about 90% on average, and outperformed a comprehensive list of baseline models and had a 7% improvement over the prior state-of-the-art (without data augmentation). We also demonstrate that synthetic wound image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) did not improve wound assessment.

,,Innovative Treatment Strategies to Accelerate Wound Healing: Trajectory and Recent Advancements,Cells,2022.0,"Wound healing is highly specialized dynamic multiple phase process for the repair of damaged/injured tissues through an intricate mechanism. Any failure in the normal wound healing process results in abnormal scar formation, and chronic state which is more susceptible to infections. Chronic wounds affect patients’ quality of life along with increased morbidity and mortality and are huge financial burden to healthcare systems worldwide, and thus requires specialized biomedical intensive treatment for its management. The clinical assessment and management of chronic wounds remains challenging despite the development of various therapeutic regimens owing to its painstakingly long-term treatment requirement and complex wound healing mechanism. Various conventional approaches such as cell therapy, gene therapy, growth factor delivery, wound dressings, and skin grafts etc., are being utilized for promoting wound healing in different types of wounds. However, all these abovementioned therapies are not satisfactory for all wound types, therefore, there is an urgent demand for the development of competitive therapies. Therefore, there is a pertinent requirement to develop newer and innovative treatment modalities for multipart therapeutic regimens for chronic wounds. Recent developments in advanced wound care technology includes nanotherapeutics, stem cells therapy, bioengineered skin grafts, and 3D bioprinting-based strategies for improving therapeutic outcomes with a focus on skin regeneration with minimal side effects. The main objective of this review is to provide an updated overview of progress in therapeutic options in chronic wounds healing and management over the years using next generation innovative approaches. Herein, we have discussed the skin function and anatomy, wounds and wound healing processes, followed by conventional treatment modalities for wound healing and skin regeneration. Furthermore, various emerging and innovative strategies for promoting quality wound healing such as nanotherapeutics, stem cells therapy, 3D bioprinted skin, extracellular matrix-based approaches, platelet-rich plasma-based approaches, and cold plasma treatment therapy have been discussed with their benefits and shortcomings.

,,Problems of healing chronic wounds,Modern medical technology,2023.0,"Aim. The work aimed to analyze and highlight the problems of chronic wound healing and modern methods of stimulation of reparative processes according to literature sources. 
An analysis of the scientific literature was carried out, in which views on the problems of wound healing are presented, taking into account the factors affecting the formation and healing of chronic wounds, and modern methods that stimulate reparation processes. Identifying the problems of wound healing will allow a comprehensive approach to the assessment of the wound process, taking into account the factors affecting the healing of injuries. 
Modern scientists are actively discussing the problems of wound healing, researching factors influencing the reparative process, including the high prevalence of chronic wounds, diagnosis and treatment of wound infections, age of patients, and state of immunity. In the case of systemic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular pathology, etc., there is a violation of microcirculation, and as a result, there are violations of the phasing of reparative processes at the cellular level. As a result, the alteration process does not end and the process becomes chronic. 
In case of a mechanical injury, when adaptation reserves are reduced, primarily of the neurohumoral system, a key role is played by the disruption of regulatory mechanisms at the cellular level. Wound treatment requires surgical treatment, stimulation of angiogenesis, and other reparative processes at the systemic and local levels. 
In recent years, various methods of stimulating reparative processes have been used in clinical practice to treat wounds: local administration of recombinant growth factors, use of platelet-rich plasma, biotechnological wound dressings, and artificial skin substitutes. One of the most promising areas of wound treatment is the development of methods for targeted activation of stem cells. However, there are still insufficient data for the practical application of this method. Clinically effective and safe methods are still being developed. Physical methods are promising for improving the healing of chronic wounds. However, the selection of optimal parameters for physical action continues to be an urgent task. Despite the positive results obtained using the methods described above, there is a need for additional experimental studies and randomized controlled trials. 
Conclusions. Chronic wounds develop as a result of severe systemic diseases, and major mechanical injuries against the background of a decrease in physiological reserves due to emotional and psychological stress, obesity, etc. Choosing the right method of influencing the reparative process, taking into account the leading mechanism of damage repair, becomes very important to ensure the best chance for optimal wound healing.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,5.0

,,Healing profiles in patients with a chronic diabetic foot ulcer: An exploratory study with machine learning,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2023.0,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most frequent and debilitating complications of diabetes. DFU wound healing is a highly complex process, resulting in significant medical, economic and social challenges. Therefore, early identification of patients with a high‐risk profile would be important to adequate treatment and more successful health outcomes. This study explores risk assessment profiles for DFU healing and healing prognosis, using machine learning predictive approaches and decision tree algorithms. Patients were evaluated at baseline (T0; N = 158) and 2 months later (T1; N = 108) on sociodemographic, clinical, biochemical and psychological variables. The performance evaluation of the models comprised F1‐score, accuracy, precision and recall. Only profiles with F1‐score >0.7 were selected for analysis. According to the two profiles generated for DFU healing, the most important predictive factors were illness representations on T1 IPQ‐B (IPQ‐B ≤ 9.5 and < 10.5) and the DFU duration (≤ 13 weeks). The two predictive models for DFU healing prognosis suggest that biochemical factors are the best predictors of a favorable healing prognosis, namely IL‐6, microRNA‐146a‐5p and PECAM‐1 at T0 and angiopoietin‐2 at T1. Illness perception at T0 (IPQ‐B ≤ 39.5) also emerged as a relevant predictor for healing prognosis. The results emphasize the importance of DFU duration, illness perception and biochemical markers as predictors of healing in chronic DFUs.

,,Individualized Risk Prediction for Improved Chronic Wound Management,Advances in Wound Care,2022.0,"Significance: Chronic wounds are associated with significant morbidity, marked loss of quality of life, and considerable economic burden. Evidence-based risk prediction to guide improved wound prevention and treatment is limited by the complexity in their etiology, clinical underreporting, and a lack of studies using large high-quality datasets. Recent Advancements: The objective of this review is to summarize key components and challenges in the development of personalized risk prediction tools for both prevention and management of chronic wounds, while highlighting several innovations in the development of better risk stratification. Critical Issues: Regression-based risk prediction approaches remain important for assessment of prognosis and risk stratification in chronic wound management. Advances in statistical computing have boosted the development of several promising machine learning (ML) and other semiautomated classification tools. These methods may be better placed to handle large number of wound healing risk factors from large datasets, potentially resulting in better risk prediction when combined with conventional methods and clinical experience and expertise. Future Directions: Where the number of predictors is large and heterogenous, the correlations between various risk factors complex, and very large data sets are available, ML may prove a powerful adjuvant for risk stratifying patients predisposed to chronic wounds. Conventional regression-based approaches remain important, particularly where the number of predictors is relatively small.

,,Mesenchymal stem cells for chronic wound healing: current status of preclinical and clinical studies.,"Tissue engineering. Part B, Reviews",2020.0,"Healing skin wounds with anatomic and functional integrity, especially under chronic pathological conditions, remains an enormous challenge. Due to their outstanding regenerative potential, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been explored in many studies to determine the healing ability for difficult-to-treat diseases. In this article, we review current animal studies and clinical trials of MSC-based therapy for chronic wounds, and discuss major challenges that confront future clinical applications. We found that a wealth of animal studies have revealed the versatile roles and the benefits of MSCs for chronic wound healing. MSC treatment results in enhanced angiogenesis, facilitated reepithelialization, improved granulation, and accelerated wound closure. There are some evidences of the transdifferentiation of MSCs into skin cells. However, the healing effect of MSCs depends primarily on their paracrine actions, which alleviate the harsh microenvironment of chronic wounds and regulate local cellular responses. Consistent with the findings of preclinical studies, some clinical trials have shown improved wound healing after transplantation of MSCs in chronic wounds, mainly lower extremity ulcers, pressure sores, and radiation burns. However, there are some limitations in these clinical trials, especially a small number of patients and imperfect methodology. Therefore, to better define the safety and efficiency of MSC-based wound therapy, large-scale controlled multicenter trials are needed in the future. In addition, to build a robust pool of clinical evidence, standardized protocols, especially the cultivation and quality control of MSCs, are recommended.

This is to reduce the risk of delay in wound healing which could lead to chronic wound. Aim: This is a systematic review of the effect of Centella asiatica on wound healing. C. asiatica is a traditional medicinal plant used due to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and wound healing properties. Methods: PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed for the systematic review and four electronic databases were used. Results: Four clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The following distinct areas were identified under C. asiatica: wound contraction and granulation; healing/bleeding time and re-epithelialization; VAS (visual analogue scale) scores; skin erythema and wound appearance. Conclusions: C. asiatica might enhance wound healing resulting from improved angiogenesis. This might occur due to its stimulating effect on collagen I, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) production. Besides, C. asiatica has shown an anti-inflammatory effect observed by the reduction in Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNFα), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and lipoxygenase (LOX) activity.

,,"Patient-Centered Chronic Wound Care Mobile Apps: Systematic Identification, Analysis, and Assessment",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2023.0,"Abstract Background The prevalence of chronic wounds is predicted to increase within the aging populations in industrialized countries. Patients experience significant distress due to pain, wound secretions, and the resulting immobilization. As the number of wounds continues to rise, their adequate care becomes increasingly costly in terms of health care resources worldwide. eHealth support systems are being increasingly integrated into patient care. However, to date, no systematic analysis of such apps for chronic wounds has been published. Objective The aims of this study were to systematically identify and subjectively assess publicly available German- or English-language mobile apps for patients with chronic wounds, with quality assessments performed by both patients and physicians. Methods Two reviewers independently conducted a systematic search and assessment of German- or English-language mobile apps for patients with chronic wounds that were available in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store from April 2022 to May 2022. In total, 3 apps met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were reviewed independently by 10 physicians using the German Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The app with the highest mean MARS score was subsequently reviewed by 11 patients with chronic wounds using the German user version of the MARS (uMARS) and the SUS. Additionally, Affinity for Technology Interaction (ATI) scale scores were collected from both patients and physicians. Results This study assessed mobile apps for patients with chronic wounds that were selected from a pool of 118 identified apps. Of the 73 apps available in both app stores, 10 were patient oriented. After excluding apps with advertisements or costs, 3 apps were evaluated by 10 physicians. Mean MARS scores ranged from 2.64 (SD 0.65) to 3.88 (SD 0.65) out of 5, and mean SUS scores ranged from 50.75 (SD 27) to 80.5 (SD 17.7) out of 100. WUND APP received the highest mean MARS score (mean 3.88, SD 0.65 out of 5) among physicians. Hence, it was subsequently assessed by 11 patients and achieved a similar rating (uMARS score: mean 3.89, SD 0.4 out of 5). Technical affinity, as measured with the ATI scale, was slightly lower in patients (score: mean 3.62, SD 1.35 out of 6) compared to physicians (score: mean 3.88, SD 1.03 out 6). Conclusions The quality ratings from physicians and patients were comparable and indicated mediocre app quality. Technical affinity, as assessed by using the ATI scale, was slightly lower for patients. Adequate apps for patients with chronic wounds remain limited, emphasizing the need for improved app development to meet patient needs.

,,Novel Cellulose Fibre-Based Flexible Plasmonic Membrane for Point-of-Care SERS Biomarker Detection in Chronic Wound Healing,International Journal of Nanomedicine,2021.0,"Background Wound management is stretching the limits of health systems globally, challenging clinicians to evaluate the effectiveness of their treatments and deliver appropriate care to their patients. Visual inspection and manual measurement of wound size are subjective, often inaccurate and inconsistent. Growth factors, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases, play important roles in cutaneous wound healing. However, little is known about the point-of-care monitoring of the changes in such markers during the healing process. Here, we explore the capability of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a viable point-of-care platform to monitor the changes of these surrogate indicators of healing status in chronic wounds. Methods We developed a biofunctionalized flexible, cost-effective, scalable and easy-to-fabricate plasmonic SERS substrate using cellulose fibre (CF), which is used for sensing of wound markers based on a modified immunoassay method. Results We evaluated and selected the reliable silver nano-island thickness that will be sputtered onto the CF-based substrate for the highest SERS enhancement. Using this biofunctionalized SERS substrate, we detected varying concentrations of MMP-9 (10–5000 ng/mL) and TNF-α (5–100 ng/mL) proteins to model the wound exudates. This SERS detection method demonstrates a linear response within biologically relevant concentrations, ranging from 10 to 500 ng/mL for MMP-9 and 5 to 25 ng/mL for TNF-α for these surrogate indicators. Conclusion Our SERS sensing platform achieved detection limits in the µM to sub-nM range and displayed high sensitivity and selectivity. This could result in a cheap, point-of-care device that provides a non-invasive measure of cutaneous wound healing in real time. We envision that these flexible substrates after activation may be incorporated into wound dressings in future for routine monitoring of wound healing status.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,1,0,1,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,none,6.0
,,Rosuvastatin calcium-based novel nanocubic vesicles capped with silver nanoparticles-loaded hydrogel for wound healing management: optimization employing Box–Behnken design: in vitro and in vivo assessment,Journal of Liposome Research,2020.0,"Abstract Chronic wounds are a serious problem that could cause severe morbidity and even death. The ability of statins including rosuvastatin calcium (RVS) to enhance wound healing was well reported. However, RVS is poorly soluble and has low bioavailability. Thus, this study aimed to prepare and evaluate RVS-loaded nanocubics to enhance its skin performance. In addition, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) exhibited potent antimicrobial activity, thus, the optimum RVS-loaded nanocubics was capped with AgNPs to evaluate its effect in wound management. Box–Behnken design was adopted to prepare RVS nanocubics. The design investigated the effect of lecithin, poloxamer 407 concentrations and hydration time on vesicle size, zeta potential (ZP), entrapment efficiency (EE%) and in vitro drug release%. Optimum formulation capped with AgNPs was incorporated into a gel base and examined for wound healing efficiency using different pharmacological tests in rats. Nanocubics have shown a mean diameter between 167.2 ± 7.8 and 408 ± 18.4 nm, ZP values ranging from −20.9 ± 1.9 to −53.5 ± 4 mV, EE% equivocated between 31.6 ± 1.4 and 94.4 ± 8.6 and drug release after 12 h between 17.9 ± 1.9 and 68.0 ± 4.0%. The histopathological studies and serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels confirmed the greater efficacy of RVS nanocubics capped with AgNPs gel in wound healing when compared with gentamicin ointment.

,,Small extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells: A potential Weapon for chronic non-healing wound treatment,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2023.0,"Chronic non-healing wounds have posed a severe threat to patients mentally and physically. Behavior dysregulation of remaining cells at wound sites is recognized as the chief culprit to destroy healing process and hinders wound healing. Therefore, regulating and restoring normal cellular behavior is the core of chronic non-healing wound treatment. In recent years, the therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has become a promising option for chronic wound healing and the efficacy has increasingly been attributed to their exocrine functions. Small extracellular vesicles derived from MSCs (MSC-sEVs) are reported to benefit almost all stages of wound healing by regulating the cellular behavior to participate in the process of inflammatory response, angiogenesis, re-epithelization, and scarless healing. Here, we describe the characteristics of MSC-sEVs and discuss their therapeutic potential in chronic wound treatment.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate biopolymer-based thermoreversible injectable hydrogels for effective wound-healing applications and the controlled drug delivery of meropenem. The injectable hydrogel was developed using the solvent casting method and evaluated for structural changes using proton nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated the self-assembly of hyaluronic acid and kappa-carrageenan and the thermal stability of the fabricated injectable hydrogel with tunable gelation properties. The viscosity assessment indicated the in-situ gelling ability and injectability of the hydrogels at various temperatures. The fabricated hydrogel was loaded with meropenem, and the drug release from the hydrogel in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with a pH of 7.4 was 96.12%, and the simulated wound fluid with a pH of 6.8 was observed to be at 94.73% at 24 h, which corresponds to the sustained delivery of meropenem. Antibacterial studies on P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and E. coli with meropenem-laden hydrogel showed higher zones of inhibition. The in vivo studies in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats presented accelerated healing with the drug-loaded injectable hydrogel, while 90% wound closure with the unloaded injectable hydrogel, 70% in the positive control group (SC drug), and 60% in the negative control group was observed (normal saline) after fourteen days.

,,Efficacy of Stamp Skin Grafting to Promote the Healing Process of Chronic Wounds,Advances in Skin & Wound Care,2025.0,"ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy of stamp skin grafting in promoting wound healing for patients with chronic wounds. METHODS: This study enrolled 86 patients with chronic wounds from a wound care clinic between November 2022 and December 2023. The participants were randomly allocated into the control (n = 44) and skin-grafting (n = 42) groups using a preset random number table. The control group received conventional wet dressing care, whereas the skin-grafting group underwent additional stamp skin-grafting care. RESULTS: The skin-grafting group demonstrated significantly reduced wound healing time, improved healing efficacy, decreased dressing change frequency, and lowered dressing change costs compared with the control group (all Ps < .05). During the nursing process, the skin-grafting group exhibited significantly lower pretreatment Numeric Rating Scale scores when the fourth and fifth dressings were changed and during-treatment Visual Analog Scale scores from the third to fifth dressing changes compared with the control group (all Ps < .05). After adjusting for confounding factors, wound area served as an independent risk factor for both healing time (r partial = 0.457, P < .05) and healing efficacy (β = −0.559, P < .05) in the skin-grafting group, whereas patient adherence to wound care served as an independent risk factor for both healing time (r partial = 0.333, P < .05) and healing efficacy (β = 1.194, P < .05) in the control group, as well as for healing efficacy (β = 1.318, P < .05) in the skin-grafting group.

Existing methods involve embedd ingorganic dyes or flexible electronics into preformed hydrogels, which raise safety issues and adaptability challenges. In this study, an injectable hydrogel based smart wound dressing is developed by integrating food‐derived anthocyanidin as a visual pH probe for infection monitoring and poly(L‐lactic acid) microcapsules as ultrasound‐responsive delivery systems for antibiotics into a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel. This straightforwardly prepared hydrogel dressing maintains its favorable properties for wound repair, including porous morphology and excellent biocompatibility. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the hydrogel enabled visual assessment of pH within the range of 5 ∼ 9.Meanwhile, the release of antibiotics could be triggered and controlled by ultrasound. In vivo evaluations using infected wounds and diabetic wounds revealed that the wound dressing effectively detected wound infection by monitoring pH levels and achieved antibacterial effects through ultrasound‐triggered drug release. This led to significantly enhanced wound healing, as validated by histological analysis and the measurement of inflammatory cytokine levels.

Determine the validity and reliability of the LIMB-Q scales, Function and Symptoms, in patients with chronic lower extremity wounds.


APPROACH
Cognitive debriefing interviews with people with current or previous wounds were conducted to examine content validity. Scales were field-tested in an international sample of people with chronic lower extremity wounds sourced from an online platform (i.e., Prolific). Psychometric properties were examined using Rasch Measurement Theory analysis. A test-retest reproducibility study was performed, and construct validity examined.


RESULTS
Content validity was established after 10 cognitive interviews. A total of 233 people with lower extremity wounds (age 19-80 years, mean 39.3) participated in the field-test. All 25 items tested demonstrated good fit to the Rasch model with ordered thresholds. One item had a fit residual outside ± 2.5, but no items had significant χ2 values after Bonferroni adjustment. Reliability was high with Person Separation Index, Cronbach alpha, and intraclass correlation coefficients values >0.8. Strong correlations were found between the Function and Symptoms scales and EQ-5D dimensions measuring similar constructs as well as the EQ-5D global score. All hypothesis for construct validity were confirmed.


INNOVATION
PROMs are an important component of patient-centered care, as they capture the patient's perspective in a rigorous and reproducible way. Adding these two scales to the WOUND-Q provides a means to measure function and symptoms associated with lower extremity wounds.

,,Bacterial Cellulose-Based Materials as Dressings for Wound Healing,Pharmaceutics,2023.0,"Bacterial cellulose (BC) is produced by several microorganisms as extracellular structures and can be modified by various physicochemical and biological strategies to produce different cellulosic formats. The main advantages of BC for biomedical applications can be summarized thus: easy moldability, purification, and scalability; high biocompatibility; and straightforward tailoring. The presence of a high amount of free hydroxyl residues, linked with water and nanoporous morphology, makes BC polymer an ideal candidate for wound healing. In this frame, acute and chronic wounds, associated with prevalent pathologies, were addressed to find adequate therapeutic strategies. Hence, the main characteristics of different BC structures—such as membranes and films, fibrous and spheroidal, nanocrystals and nanofibers, and different BC blends, as well as recent advances in BC composites with alginate, collagen, chitosan, silk sericin, and some miscellaneous blends—are reported in detail.

,,Clinical approach to chronic wound management in older adults,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2021.0,"Older adults are at high risk of developing chronic wounds due to numerous changes that occur with aging. It is reasonable to consider chronic wounds as a geriatric syndrome—highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Due to the morbidity and cost associated with chronic wounds, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment are important. The most common chronic wounds presenting in older adults are pressure and vascular wounds, including those associated with diabetes. Atypical wounds are also common and should raise the suspicion for skin malignancy. Diagnosis is primarily clinical and assessment should include documentation of wound characteristics, such as location, size and depth, presence of slough, drainage, odor, and infection. The mainstay of treatment is based on the TIME principle: Tissue debridement, Infection control, Moisture balance, and optimal wound Edges. The use of protein supplements has been shown to improve wound healing in subsets of older adults. In addition to wound care and optimizing nutrition, disease‐specific wound therapy forms an integral part of wound management. Pressure reduction for pressure injury, compression therapy for venous wounds, evaluation of arterial circulation with ABI or arterial Doppler and iCC for diabetic ulcers form the mainstays of therapy. Atypical wounds may present as chronic ulcers and should be biopsied. The goals of treatment should be realistic and for some older adults, palliative wound management may be more appropriate.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,5.0
,,Antimicrobial Nano-Zinc Oxide Biocomposites for Wound Healing Applications: A Review,Pharmaceutics,2023.0,"Chronic wounds are a major concern for global health, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. As their occurrence is correlated with age and age-related comorbidities, their incidence in the population is set to increase in the forthcoming years. This burden is further worsened by the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which causes wound infections that are increasingly hard to treat with current antibiotics. Antimicrobial bionanocomposites are an emerging class of materials that combine the biocompatibility and tissue-mimicking properties of biomacromolecules with the antimicrobial activity of metal or metal oxide nanoparticles. Among these nanostructured agents, zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the most promising for its microbicidal effects and its anti-inflammatory properties, and as a source of essential zinc ions. This review analyses the most recent developments in the field of nano-ZnO–bionanocomposite (nZnO-BNC) materials—mainly in the form of films, but also hydrogel or electrospun bandages—from the different preparation techniques to their properties and antibacterial and wound-healing performances. The effect of nanostructured ZnO on the mechanical, water and gas barrier, swelling, optical, thermal, water affinity, and drug-release properties are examined and linked to the preparation methods. Antimicrobial assays over a wide range of bacterial strains are extensively surveyed, and wound-healing studies are finally considered to provide a comprehensive assessment framework. While early results are promising, a systematic and standardised testing procedure for the comparison of antibacterial properties is still lacking, partly because of a not-yet fully understood antimicrobial mechanism. This work, therefore, allowed, on one hand, the determination of the best strategies for the design, engineering, and application of n-ZnO-BNC, and, on the other hand, the identification of the current challenges and opportunities for future research.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,none,10.0
,,Triboelectric‐Responsive Drug Delivery Hydrogel for Accelerating Infected Wound Healing,Advanced Healthcare Materials,2024.0,"Electrotherapy is of great interest in the field of tissue repair as an effective, well‐tolerated, and noninvasive treatment. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has shown advantages in promoting wound healing due to its peak output characteristic and low Joule heating effect. However, it is limited in infected wound healing due to poor antimicrobial capacity. Here, a wearable triboelectric stimulator (WTS) is developed that consists of a flexible TENG (F‐TENG) and a triboelectric‐responsive drug delivery hydrogel (TR‐DDH) for healing of bacterium‐infected wounds. F‐TENG can generate pulsed current to wounds by converting mechanical energy from body movements. Polypyrrole is prone to reduction and volume contraction under electrical stimulation, resulting in desorption of curcumin nanoparticles (CUR NPs) from the polypyrrole in TR‐DDH. Therefore, the highly efficient and controllable release of CUR NPs can be achieved by triboelectric stimulation. According to the in vitro and in vivo experiments, WTS has the greatest antimicrobial effect and the fastest promotion of infected wound healing compared to treatment with electrical stimulation or curcumin. Finally, the safety assessment demonstrates that the WTS has excellent tissue safety for chronic wound healing. Synergistic therapy with WTS provides an efficient strategy for chronic wound healing and smart‐responsive drug delivery systems.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,none,4.0
,,The efficacy of topical oxygen therapy for wound healing: A meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"In preclinical studies, topical oxygen treatment (TOT) was shown to enhance wound healing by applying supplemental oxygen topically to the surface of a moist wound at normobaric conditions. The objective of this systematic review and meta‐analysis is to provide a thorough evaluation of published RCTs and observational studies that compare supplemental TOT with standard wound care. A total of 1077 studies were obtained from a variety of databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, ProQuest, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trial Registers, and Preprints.org. The Jadad scale was employed to assess the reliability of RCT studies, while the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale (NOS) was employed to assess the quality of observational studies. Seven RCT studies (n = 692) and two controlled observational studies (n = 111) were analysed. The rate of healed wounds was 25.8% in the control group and 43.25% in the adjuvant TOT group, which shows the use of TOT significantly increased the number of healed wounds (RR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.18–2.64; p = 0.005). A significant decrease in the percentage of wound area was found in the TOT group in RCT studies (mean difference = 15.64; 95% CI 5.22–26.06; p = 0.003). In observational studies, the rate of healed wounds was 37.5% in the standard care group and 80.95% in the adjuvant TOT group, which shows a significant increase in the number of healed wounds in the adjuvant TOT group (RR = 2.15; 95% CI 1.46–3.15; p < 0.00001).

,,Optimising wound care for patients with cirrhosis: A study of the effect of combination therapy on wound healing,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"Cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease, significantly impairs wound healing due to complex alterations in physiology, including compromised immune function, poor nutritional status and altered blood flow. This prospective observational cohort study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the multidimensional combination therapy approach in enhancing wound healing among patients diagnosed with cirrhosis. The study was conducted from February to November 2023 in Shanghai, China, including 248 patients with cirrhosis experiencing poor wound healing. The combination therapy consisted of tailored pharmacological treatments, advanced wound dressings, dietitian‐directed dietary regimens and supplementary therapies like negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), stem cell and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The interventions were customised based on comprehensive initial assessments of liver function, nutritional status and wound characteristics. Follow‐ups were conducted to monitor response and adjust treatments accordingly. The patient demographic was varied, predominantly 41–60 years old, with the slight male predominance. The study demonstrated that after 3 months of treatment, wound sizes decreased significantly across all cirrhosis severity levels: mild (2.4–1.7 cm2), moderate (4.1–2.6 cm2) and severe (6.2–4.4 cm2). Healing rates improved to 90% in mild, 75% in moderate and 45% in severe cases over 6 months. Albumin levels increased by the average of +0.3 g/dL to +0.4 g/dL post‐treatment across the severity spectrum. However, complication rates escalated with severity: Mild cases had a 10% infection rate, while severe cases had up to 30% infection rate. Combination therapy significantly improved wound healing in cirrhosis patients, with the extent of improvement correlated with the severity of the condition. Tailored, multidisciplinary approaches are critical in managing the intricate wound healing process in cirrhosis, effectively reducing healing times and improving overall treatment outcomes.

,,Effectiveness of Arginine Supplementation on Wound Healing in Older Adults in Acute and Chronic Settings: A Systematic Review.,Advances in Skin & Wound Care,2019.0,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the effect of arginine supplementation on wound healing, as measured by wound size and healing rate, in older adults in acute and long-term care (LTC) settings.


DATA SOURCES
PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey databases.


STUDY SELECTION
Randomized clinical trials and clinical studies were considered for this review. Selection criteria included English-language articles published after 2008 that provide data on older adults with pressure injury receiving arginine supplementation in acute care and LTC settings.


DATA EXTRACTION
Data were extracted from the articles using a predefined checklist including study size and design, participant characteristics (age, pressure injury stage, relevant comorbidities), nutrition intervention and dosage, duration of study, outcomes, and publication year. Studies were appraised using the National Institutes of Health's Quality Assessment of Controlled Intervention Studies tool.


DATA SYNTHESIS
A preliminary search yielded 39 articles after removing duplicates. Abstracts and titles of articles were screened, and 23 full-text articles were examined further. Ultimately, six articles met the inclusion criteria.


CONCLUSIONS
Current evidence suggests that arginine supplementation in conjunction with oral nutrition supplementation may promote wound healing in older adult patients in acute care and LTC settings as evidenced by significant reductions in wound size and improvements in wound healing when compared with oral nutrition supplementation alone. A definitive conclusion about the use of arginine supplementation alone to promote wound healing cannot be drawn because of limitations in the available literature.

Biosimilars of bevacizumab have emerged as crucial therapeutic agents in the management of these complications. With the particular emphasis on effects of Bevacizumab Biosimilar Plus on wound healing among patients diagnosed with CRC, this review underscores the potential of this anorectal medication to improve patient outcomes and was aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of Bevacizumab Biosimilar Plus in relation to complications associated with wound healing in patients with CRC. The assessment centers on its therapeutic potential and safety profile within the domain of anorectal medicine. In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was performed, resulting in the identification of 19 pertinent studies out of an initial 918. Priority was given to assessing the safety and adverse effects of Bevacizumab Biosimilar Plus in conjunction with its effectiveness in wound healing. The extracted data comprised the following: study design, patient demographics, comprehensive treatment regimens, wound healing‐specific outcomes and adverse effects. The evaluation of study quality was conducted utilizing the instruments provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale (NOS).

A computerised search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases for studies on the effect of PRF on post‐extraction wound healing and pain compared with natural healing (control group) was performed from the time of creation of the respective databases to July 2023. Literature screening, data extraction and quality assessment were done independently by two authors. Meta‐analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Fourteen studies with a total of 508 patients were finally included. Meta‐analysis showed that the use of PRF relieved patients' wound pain (standardised mean differences [SMDs]: −1.78, 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: −2.61 to −0.94, p < 0.001), promoted soft tissue healing of extraction wounds (SMD: 1.09, 95% CIs: 0.26–1.91, p = 0.010) and also reduced the incidence of alveolar osteitis (AO) in patients after tooth extraction (2.42% vs. 10.14%, odds ratio: 0.27, 95% CIs: 0.11–0.65, p = 0.004). Current clinical evidence suggests that the use of PRFs can reduce patients' postoperative wound pain, promote soft tissue healing of extraction wounds and reduce the incidence of postoperative AO compared with natural healing.

,,Examining the relationship between nutritional status and wound healing in head and neck cancer treatment: A focus on malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"The research was conducted to examine the correlation between nutritional status and wound healing in individuals who were receiving treatment for head and neck cancer. Specifically, this study sought to identify crucial nutritional factors that influenced both the recovery process and efficacy of the treatment. From February 2022 to September 2023, this cross‐sectional study was undertaken involving 300 patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer who were treated at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China. In order to evaluate nutritional status, body mass index (BMI), serum protein levels and dietary intake records were utilized. The assessment of wound healing was conducted using established oncological wound healing scales, photographic documentation and clinical examinations. After treatment, we observed a noteworthy reduction in both BMI (p < 0.05) and serum albumin levels (p < 0.05). There was slightly increased prevalence of head and neck cancer among males (61.0%, p < 0.05). Over the course of 6 months, significant enhancement in wound healing scores was noted, exhibiting overall improvement of 86% in the healing process. An inverse correlation was identified between nutritional status and wound healing efficacy through multivariate analysis. A logistic regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between elevated levels of serum protein and total lymphocytes and enhanced wound healing. Conversely, negative correlation (p < 0.05) was observed between larger wound size at baseline and healing. The research findings indicated noteworthy association between malnutrition and impaired wound repair among individuals diagnosed with head and neck cancer. The results underscored the significance of integrating nutritional interventions into therapeutic protocol in order to enhance clinical results.

,,Carbon Dot-Doped Hydrogel Sensor Array for Multiplexed Colorimetric Detection of Wound Healing.,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2023.0,"Effective wound care and treatment require a quick and comprehensive assessment of healing status. Here, we develop a carbon dot-doped hydrogel sensor array in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for simultaneous colorimetric detections of five wound biomarkers and/or wound condition indicators (pH, glucose, urea, uric acid, and total protein), leading to the holistic assessment of inflammation and infection. A biogenic carbon dot synthesized using an amino acid and a polymer precursor is doped in an agarose hydrogel matrix for constructing enzymatic sensors (glucose, urea, and uric acid) and dye-based sensors (pH and total protein). The encapsulated enzymes in such a matrix exhibit improved enzyme kinetics and stability compared to those in pure hydrogels. Such a matrix also provides stable colorimetric responses for all five sensors. The sensor array exhibits high accuracy (recovery rates of 91.5-113.1%) and clinically relevant detection ranges for all five wound markers. The sensor array is established for simulated wound fluids and validated with rat wound fluids from perturbed wound models. Distinct color patterns are obtained that can clearly distinguish healing vs nonhealing wounds visually and quantitatively. This hydrogel sensor array shows great potential for on-site wound sensing due to its long-term stability, lightweight, and flexibility.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,5.0
,,Effect of a wound healing protocol on patients with stage III and IV pressure ulcers: a preliminary observational study.,Journal of wound care,2022.0,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the influence of a wound healing protocol for stage III and IV pressure ulcers (PUs), and to determine the predictive power of specific sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on wound healing and infection.


METHOD
This longitudinal study included participants with stage III and IV PUs who were recruited from 10 acute care settings of an Italian university hospital, and who were managed with a protocol inspired by the TIMECare model. Data were collected between October 2018 and March 2019. The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel Staging System was used to stage the PUs. Wound healing was assessed with the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH). Nutritional status was assessed with the Mini Nutritional Assessment Index. Data collection took place at admission and every seven days thereafter-a total of six times before discharge. The outcome and predictors of wound healing were assessed with Student's paired t-tests and multiple linear regressions, respectively.


RESULTS
Patients (n=126) were almost equally split between male and female, with a mean age of 78.17 years and who were all retired. Stage III and IV PUs were most prevalent at the sacrum (65.5% and 73.2%, respectively). PUSH wound healing scores improved significantly after six weeks in both stage III and IV PUs (p<0.001). Nutritional status was predictive of wound healing (R2=0.12).


CONCLUSION
Our results showed that a good nutritional status and a protocol inspired by the TIMECare model were associated with wound healing improvements in stage III and IV PUs.

,,The clinical impact of hydro-responsive dressings in dynamic wound healing: Part II.,Journal of wound care,2022.0,"OBJECTIVE
Over the course of a wound's healing trajectory, whether the wound is acute or hard-to-heal, management is likely to involve the use of several different dressing types. Minimising the complexity of treatment (in terms of dressing usage) would aid clinicians in providing effective wound care but excellent clinical outcomes must remain the primary goal.


METHOD
This study was an open-labelled, non-comparative study assessing the clinical effectiveness of a coordinated wound dressing treatment regimen. After an initial phase of using a hydro-responsive wound dressing (HydroClean, HRWD-1, PAUL HARTMANN AG, Germany) to cleanse and debride hard-to-heal wounds, the wounds were subsequently treated with either HydroTac (HRWD-2, PAUL HARTMANN AG, Germany) (to maintain healing progression and re-epithelialisation) or RespoSorb (a superabsorbent dressing, PAUL HARTMANN AG, Germany) (to manage moderate-to-high levels of exudate). The Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) assessment tool was used to measure the wound status over the course of the treatment period and to assess several wound status parameters (for example, wound area, exudate levels and wound characteristics such as level of re-epithelialisation).


RESULTS
The results from this study demonstrated that wounds treated with HRWD-2 showed a positive healing response when using the PUSH score assessment tool with a significant mean reduction (p<0.0001) in the PUSH score of wounds treated with HRWD-2, with >75% of wounds being closed by the end of the study. This result underlines the effectiveness of HRWD-2 in supporting healing progression.

The inclusion of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) into wound care outcome assessment will provide important information. The WOUND-Q is a new PROM developed to measure outcomes for people with chronic wounds. This study aimed to perform a linguistic validation/cultural adaption of the WOUND-Q from English into Danish and Dutch. The field-test version of the WOUND-Q is a comprehensive PROM composed of 222 items in 16 independently functioning scales. We followed the rigorous guidelines set forth by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) and the World Health Organization (WHO). These guidelines involved two forward translations, one back translation, an expert panel meeting, and cognitive debriefing interviews with patients. In the forward translation, the psychological function scale showed the greatest number of discrepancies from the English version. Comparison of the back translation of the Danish and Dutch versions with the English version identified 19 and 24 items respectively where the meaning had changed and required re-translation. A total of 38 cognitive debriefing interviews resulted in minor adjustments and demonstrated that the questionnaire had sufficient comprehensibility. The linguistic validation and cultural adaptation process is an essential step to adapting PROMs for use in other languages and cultures.

,,Serological Assessment of the Quality of Wound Healing Processes in Crohn's Disease.,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,2019.0,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by continuous mucosal damage and ongoing wound healing of the intestines. The fibrinolytic system is involved in early parts of the wound healing process. Fibrin is a key mediator of primary blood clot formation and is formed by cross-linking of fibrinogen. To gain insights into the dynamics of wound healing in CD patients we investigated the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin by the pro-peptide FPA, the amount of factor XIII cross-linked fibrin and total fibrin clot.


METHODS
Serum samples of 35 CD patients, 15 non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) patients and 39 age-matched healthy controls were analyzed for three novel neo-epitope markers: D-fragment and D-dimer, reflecting the degradation of total fibrin clot and factor XIII cross-linked fibrin, as well as FPA, reflecting synthesis of fibrin.


RESULTS
Crohn's disease patients had a significantly lower D-dimer level (p=0.0001) compared to healthy controls. Crohn's disease and non-IBD patients had a significantly higher level of FPA (p<0.0001) and D-fragment/D-dimer ratio (p<0.0001 and p=0.02). FPA, D-dimer and D-fragment/D-dimer ratio could distinguish CD patients from healthy controls with area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI 0.83-0.97), 0.78 (95% CI 0.67-0.87) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.75-0.93), respectively.


CONCLUSION
Wound healing parameters were clearly changed in CD patients. FPA levels were higher in CD patients as compared to healthy controls, indicating more ongoing wound healing. D-dimer levels were lower in CD patients than in healthy controls, indicating impaired wound healing due to poor quality of factor XIII cross-linked fibrin and clot resolution.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,1.0
,,"In vitro assessment of a novel, hypothermically stored amniotic membrane for use in a chronic wound environment",International Wound Journal,2017.0,"Chronic wounds require extensive healing time and place patients at risk of infection and amputation. Recently, a fresh hypothermically stored amniotic membrane (HSAM) was developed and has subsequently shown promise in its ability to effectively heal chronic wounds. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of action that contribute to wound‐healing responses observed with HSAM. A proteomic analysis was conducted on HSAM, measuring 25 growth factors specific to wound healing within the grafts. The rate of release of these cytokines from HSAMs was also measured. To model the effect of these cytokines and their role in wound healing, proliferation and migration assays with human fibroblasts and keratinocytes were conducted, along with tube formation assays measuring angiogenesis using media conditioned from HSAM. Additionally, the cell–matrix interactions between fibroblasts and HSAM were investigated. Conditioned media from HSAM significantly increased both fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and migration and induced more robust tube formation in angiogenesis assays. Fibroblasts cultured on HSAMs were found to migrate into and deposit matrix molecules within the HSAM graft. These collective results suggest that HSAM positively affects various critical pathways in chronic wound healing, lending further support to promising qualitative results seen clinically and providing further validation for ongoing clinical trials.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,none,14.5
,,Assessment of wound area reduction on chronic wounds in dogs with photobiomodulation therapy: A randomized controlled clinical trial,Veterinary World,2021.0,"Abstract Background and Aim: Chronic wounds are a clinical problem and require intensive standard wound care. However, this is sometimes insufficient to promote healing. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) can be used as an adjunctive therapy to improve wound healing. Various PBMT devices with different properties and parameter settings as well as different animal species can influence a variety of clinical outcomes. This study aims to assess the use of 830 nm PBMT or simultaneous superpulsed and multiple wavelengths (SPMW; 660, 875, and 905 nm) PBMT on chronic wounds in client-owned dogs. Materials and Methods: This study included 21 client-owned dogs with chronic wounds allocated into three groups: (1) Control group (C) treated with irrigated saline and without PBMT (n=7); (2) L1 group treated with irrigated saline together with the radiation of 830 nm PBMT (n=7); and (3) L2 group treated with irrigated saline together with the radiation of simultaneous SPMW-PBMT (n=7). Wound healing was assessed on the basis of wound size reduction as a percentage of wound area every 2nd day for 15 days using image analysis software (ImageJ software®, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA). Results: A significant difference in the percentage of wound area reduction was noted between the C and PBMT groups (L1 and L2; p<0.05). The average percentages of wound area reduction at the end of the study (15 days) were 42.39±20.58, 56.98±24.82, and 61.81±27.18 in the C, L1, and L2 groups, respectively. A steady decrease in wound size was noted in both PBMT and non-PBMT groups, and coefficients were 7.77, 8.95, and 10.01 in the C, L1, and L2 groups, respectively. The percentage of wound area reduction was found to be significantly different between the PBMT and non-BPMT groups on day 7 (p<0.05). Conclusion: Based on the results of the current study, using either 830 nm PBMT or simultaneous SPMW-PBMT can accelerate the chronic wound healing process in dogs with a significant reduction in wound area. Therefore, it can be used as an adjunctive therapy to improve wound healing in dogs with reduced treatment duration.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,5.0
,,Clinical validation of a smartphone application for automated wound measurement in patients with venous leg ulcers,International Wound Journal,2022.0,"Chronic wounds are associated with significant clinical, economic and quality‐of‐life burden. Despite the variety of wound imaging systems available in the market for wound assessment and surveillance, few are clinically validated among patients of Asian ethnicity. We aimed to clinically validate the accuracy of a smartphone wound application (Tissue Analytics [TA], Net Health Systems Inc, Florida, USA), versus conventional wound measurements (visual approximation and paper rulers), in patients of Asian ethnicity with venous leg ulcers (VLU). A prospective cohort study of patients presenting with VLU to a specialist wound nurse clinic over a 5‐week duration was conducted.

Inter‐rater and intra‐rater reliability between clinical and TA‐based measurements were analysed using intra‐class correlation statistics, with values of <0.5, 0.5 to 0.75, 0.75 to 0.9, and >0.9 indicating poor, moderate, good and excellent reliability, respectively. 82 patients (51% males), with a mean age at 65.8 years, completed the 5‐week study duration. 25 (30%) had underlying diabetes mellitus. Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicity comprised 68%, 12% and 11%, respectively. The VLU healed in 26 (32%) of patients within the study period. In total, 358 wound episodes with 2334 wound images were analysed. Inter‐rater reliability for length, width and area between wound nurse measurements and TA application measurements was good (range 0.799‐0.919, P < 0.001). Separate measurements of intra‐rater reliability for length, width and area within the iOS or Android systems were excellent (range 0.967‐0.985 and range 0.977‐0.984 respectively, P < 0.001). Inter‐rater reliability between TA used on the iOS and Android systems was also excellent (0.987‐0.989, P < 0.001).

,,Evaluating the role of wound‐healing genes in conjunction with stool routine and serum tumor markers for colorectal cancer diagnosis and prognostic implications,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"Colorectal cancer is a common malignant digestive tract tumour with high morbidity and mortality. Early detection, treatment and diagnosis are crucial for preventing and treating colorectal cancer, which develops through multi‐stage accumulation and gene participation, affecting tumour marker levels. Chronic wounds can lead to the development of certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer. The prolonged inflammation and tissue repair caused by chronic wounds can trigger cellular changes, potentially promoting cancerous cell growth in the colon. The formation and progression of colorectal cancer involve changes in tumour markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), sugar chain antigen 19–9 (CA199) and CA125. This study explores the clinical application value of a stool routine combined with serum tumour marker detection in diagnosing colorectal cancer. The experiment team examined the clinical information of 56 colorectal cancer patients alongside a control group of 56 healthy patients. Distinct stool characteristics and heightened occult blood rates were evident in colorectal cancer cases. The combined approach integrating stool routine and serum tumour markers improved diagnostic accuracy, displaying enhanced sensitivity and specificity compared with individual markers or stool routines alone. Bioinformatics analysis indicated increased CEA and CA125 levels in colorectal cancer tissues versus normal tissues, hinting at potential prognostic implications. Exploring wound‐healing genes like Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA), Tumour Protein 53 (TP53) and Transforming Growth Factor Alpha (TGFA) revealed heightened expression in colorectal cancer, suggesting their potential role in disease progression. These markers showed associations with various immune cell types, suggesting their impact within the tumour microenvironment (p < 0.05). Single‐cell RNA sequencing data highlighted varying CEA expressions across different cell populations in colorectal cancer. The findings indicated that integrating clinical assessments with accurate biomarkers may provide valuable insights into prognostic implications.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,1,0,0,2,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,11.5

,,Biomimetic Hydrogels to Promote Wound Healing,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2021.0,"Wound healing is a common physiological process which consists of a sequence of molecular and cellular events that occur following the onset of a tissue lesion in order to reconstitute barrier between body and external environment. The inherent properties of hydrogels allow the damaged tissue to heal by supporting a hydrated environment which has long been explored in wound management to aid in autolytic debridement. However, chronic non-healing wounds require added therapeutic features that can be achieved by incorporation of biomolecules and supporting cells to promote faster and better healing outcomes. In recent decades, numerous hydrogels have been developed and modified to match the time scale for distinct stages of wound healing. This review will discuss the effects of various types of hydrogels on wound pathophysiology, as well as the ideal characteristics of hydrogels for wound healing, crosslinking mechanism, fabrication techniques and design considerations of hydrogel engineering.

,,Prediction of Healing Trajectory of Chronic Wounds Using a Machine Learning Approach.,Advances in wound care,2024.0,"Objective: New treatment options are emerging for chronic wounds, which represent a growing problem because of population ageing and increasing burden of chronic disease. While promising, the existing evidence for advanced modalities is commonly derived from small and/or poorly controlled studies and clear criteria for selecting patients, who are likely to benefit from these expensive options are lacking. In this study, we develop and validate a machine learning model to predict if a chronic wound, independent of etiology, is expected to heal within 12 weeks to identify cases in potential need of advanced treatment options. Approach: Retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from 2014 to 2018 covering 532 wound care clinics in the United States and 261,398 patients with 620,356 unique wounds. Prediction of 12-week healing trajectories with a machine learning model. Results: The best-performing model in a training dataset of a randomly drawn 75% subset of wounds contained variables for patient demographics, comorbidities, wound characteristics at initial presentation, and changes in wound dimensions over time, with the latter group being the most influential predictors. The final machine learning model had a high predictive accuracy with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.9 and 0.92 after 4 and 5 weeks of treatment, respectively. Innovation: A machine learning model can identify chronic wounds at risk of not healing by week 12 with high accuracy in the early weeks of treatment.

,,The clinical value of intelligent wound measurement devices in patients with chronic wounds: A scoping review,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"Chronic wounds are common in clinical practice, with long treatment cycle and high treatment cost. Changes in wound area can well predict the effectiveness of treatment and the possibility of healing. Therefore, continuous wound monitoring and evaluation are particularly important. Traditional manual wound measurement tends to overestimate wound area. Recently, various intelligent wound measurement devices have been introduced into clinical practice. This review aims to summarise the reliability, validity, types and measurement principles of different intelligent wound measurement devices, so as to analyse the clinical value and application prospect. Articles numbering 2610 were retrieved from the database, and 14 articles met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that the intelligent wound measurement devices included in the study reported good reliability and validity. Contact devices can lead to wound bed damage, wound deformation, patient pain, and is not convenient for electronic wound recording; partial contact devices can complete continuous monitoring and recording of wounds, but are not sensitive to wound depth measurement. Non‐contact devices are more accurate in capturing wound images. In addition to wound measurement, they also have the function of wound assessment.

This work aims to design a wearable non‐invasive device capable of evaluating three parameters simultaneously: the pH and the levels of glucose and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) present in the wound exudate. The device is composed of three independent polymer optical fibers functionalized with fluorescent‐based sensing chemistries specific to the targeted analytes. Each fiber is characterized in terms of detection sensitivity and selectivity confirming their suitability for monitoring the targeted parameters in ranges relevant to the wound environment. The selectivity and robustness of the multi‐sensing device are confirmed with analyses using complex solutions with different pH levels (5, 6, and 7), different concentrations of glucose (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mm), and MMP (1.25, 2.5, and 5 µg mL−1).

,,Sustained delivery of MMP-9 siRNA via thermosensitive hydrogel accelerates diabetic wound healing,Journal of Nanobiotechnology,2021.0,"Abstract Excessive expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) impedes healing of diabetic chronic wounds, thus wound dressing that could effectively inhibit the expression of MMP-9 offers significant clinical translation for diabetic wound healing. Herein, a hybrid hydrogel dressing was developed for localized and sustained delivery of MMP-9 siRNA (siMMP-9). siMMP-9 was complexed with Gly-TETA (GT), the GT/siMMP9 complex was then loaded into a thermosensitive hydrogel based on Pluronic F-127 (PF) and methylcellulose (MC). In vitro , this hybrid hydrogel dressing exhibited negligible cytotoxicity, prolonged the release of GT/siMMP-9 for up to 7 days, and significantly reduced MMP-9 expression. In vivo assessment in diabetic rats demonstrated that hydrogel provided localized and sustained delivery via the thermosensitive controlled release of entrapped GT/siMMP-9 into wound tissues for 7 days, resulting in dramatic MMP-9 silencing which significantly improved diabetic wound closure. This hybrid hydrogel dressing exhibited excellent biocompatibility, with no observed systemic toxicity in rats. Taken together, the hybrid hydrogel dressing may constitute an effective and biocompatible means of enhancing diabetic wound healing through effective silencing of the MMP-9 gene, and this hydrogel delivery system also offers a platform for in vivo delivery of siRNA for the treatment of other diseases.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0

Computer searches were conducted, from database infection to November 2023, in EMBASE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of PRP combined with NPWT technology for treating chronic wounds. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data and conducted quality assessments according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Stata 17.0 software was employed for data analysis. Overall, 18 RCTs involving 1294 patients with chronic wounds were included.

,,Multifunctional Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel with Self-Healing Properties and Promoting Angiogenesis as an Immunoregulation Platform for Diabetic Wound Healing,Gels,2023.0,"Treating chronic wounds is a global challenge. In diabetes mellitus cases, long-time and excess inflammatory responses at the injury site may delay the healing of intractable wounds. Macrophage polarization (M1/M2 types) can be closely associated with inflammatory factor generation during wound healing. Quercetin (QCT) is an efficient agent against oxidation and fibrosis that promotes wound healing. It can also inhibit inflammatory responses by regulating M1-to-M2 macrophage polarization. However, its limited solubility, low bioavailability, and hydrophobicity are the main issues restricting its applicability in wound healing. The small intestinal submucosa (SIS) has also been widely studied for treating acute/chronic wounds. It is also being extensively researched as a suitable carrier for tissue regeneration. As an extracellular matrix, SIS can support angiogenesis, cell migration, and proliferation, offering growth factors involved in tissue formation signaling and assisting wound healing. We developed a series of promising biosafe novel diabetic wound repair hydrogel wound dressings with several effects, including self-healing properties, water absorption, and immunomodulatory effects. A full-thickness wound diabetic rat model was constructed for in vivo assessment of QCT@SIS hydrogel, in which hydrogels achieved a markedly increased wound repair rate. Their effect was determined by the promotion of the wound healing process, the thickness of granulation tissue, vascularization, and macrophage polarization during wound healing. At the same time, we injected the hydrogel subcutaneously into healthy rats to perform histological analyses of sections of the heart, spleen, liver, kidney, and lung. We then tested the biochemical index levels in serum to determine the biological safety of the QCT@SIS hydrogel. In this study, the developed SIS showed convergence of biological, mechanical, and wound-healing capabilities. Here, we focused on constructing a self-healing, water-absorbable, immunomodulatory, and biocompatible hydrogel as a synergistic treatment paradigm for diabetic wounds by gelling the SIS and loading QCT for slow drug release.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) has been shown to reduce wound dimensions and healing time in chronic wounds and should be considered a valuable tool in the healing of chronic complex lower extremity wounds.


PURPOSE
The aim of this small case series was to evaluate the effect of ESWT on complex chronic wounds in patients with multiple comorbidities in a medically underserved outpatient wound care clinic setting.


METHODS
All patients had baseline wound measurements taken. Pictures of the wounds were also taken at the time of the initial visit. Patients selected for ESWT received weekly treatments for a maximum recorded duration of 12 weeks in the form of focused electro-hydraulic acoustic pulses. Wound beds were cleansed according to standard of care.


RESULTS
Thirteen patients were followed with a total of 18 wounds treated. After retrospectively analyzing the data, 3 subjects and a total of 5 wounds were excluded, leaving 10 total subjects and 13 wounds. Out of these wounds, 12 healed completely by or before week 12 of ESWT. All wounds demonstrated significant wound dimension reduction during the first 12 weeks of treatment.


CONCLUSION
ESWT could offer accessible, fast, safe, and cost-effective management of some complex chronic wounds. Further research is needed to validate these findings.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0

This study aims to identify factors associated with the healing process of these wounds and develop a mobile application for wound care that incorporates these factors. A prospective multicentre cohort study was conducted in nine health units in Portugal, involving data collection through a mobile application by nurses from April to October 2022. The study followed 46 patients with 57 wounds for up to 5 weeks, conducting six evaluations. Healing time was the main outcome measure, analysed using the Mann–Whitney test and three Cox regression models to calculate risk ratios. The study sample comprised various wound types, with pressure ulcers being the most common (61.4%), followed by venous leg ulcers (17.5%) and diabetic foot ulcers (8.8%). Factors that were found to impair the wound healing process included chronic kidney disease (U = 13.50; p = 0.046), obesity (U = 18.0; p = 0.021), non‐adherence to treatment (U = 1.0; p = 0.029) and interference of the wound with daily routines (U = 11.0; p = 0.028). Risk factors for delayed healing over time were identified as bone involvement (RR 3.91; p < 0.001), presence of odour (RR 3.36; p = 0.007), presence of neuropathy (RR 2.49; p = 0.002), use of anti‐inflammatory drugs (RR 2.45; p = 0.011), stalled wound (RR 2.26; p = 0.022), greater width (RR 2.03; p = 0.002), greater depth (RR 1.72; p = 0.036) and a high score on the healing scale (RR 1.21; p = 0.001).

,,What is slough? Defining the proteomic and microbial composition of slough and its implications for wound healing,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2024.0,"Slough is a well‐known feature of non‐healing wounds. This pilot study aims to determine the proteomic and microbiologic components of slough as well as interrogate the associations between wound slough components and wound healing. Ten subjects with slow‐to‐heal wounds and visible slough were enrolled. Aetiologies included venous stasis ulcers, post‐surgical site infections and pressure ulcers. Patient co‐morbidities and wound healing outcome at 3‐months post‐sample collection was recorded. Debrided slough was analysed microscopically, through untargeted proteomics, and high‐throughput bacterial 16S‐ribosomal gene sequencing. Microscopic imaging revealed wound slough to be amorphous in structure and highly variable. 16S‐profiling found slough microbial communities to associate with wound aetiology and location on the body. Across all subjects, slough largely consisted of proteins involved in skin structure and formation, blood‐clot formation and immune processes. To predict variables associated with wound healing, protein, microbial and clinical datasets were integrated into a supervised discriminant analysis. This analysis revealed that healing wounds were enriched for proteins involved in skin barrier development and negative regulation of immune responses. While wounds that deteriorated over time started off with a higher baseline Bates‐Jensen Wound Assessment Score and were enriched for anaerobic bacterial taxa and chronic inflammatory proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate clinical, microbiome, and proteomic data to systematically characterise wound slough and integrate it into a single assessment to predict wound healing outcome. Collectively, our findings underscore how slough components can help identify wounds at risk of continued impaired healing and serves as an underutilised biomarker.",Semantic Scholar,1,0,3,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,wound_assessment,8.5
,,Therapeutic Targeting of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Improves Primary and Secondary Intention Wound Healing in Mice,Frontiers in Immunology,2021.0,"Background Neutrophils are the first responders in wound healing after injury that mediate pro- and anti-inflammatory activities i.a. through the formation of extracellular traps (NETs). However, excessive NETs presence in wound tissue can cause local hyperinflammation and -coagulation resulting in delayed wound healing. To improve wound healing, we aimed to examine the role of NETs and DNase1 on primary and secondary wound healing. Methods The study included 93 C57BL/6 mice, with 3 different genotypes: wildtype, Pad4-, and DNase1-Knockout (KO). Pad4-KO mice show limited NETs formation, while DNase1-KO mice cannot disintegrate them. All 3 genotypes were included in (1) a laparotomy group and (2) a thermal injury group. Animals in both groups either received DNase1 or a vehicle i.p. post wound induction and wound assessment and euthanasia were conducted. Laparotomy and burn scars were assessed using the stony brook scar evaluation scale and modified Yeong scale respectively. Tissue was analyzed histologically using H&E staining. Ly6g, Collagen I and III, SMA, and Fibrinogen were visualized and neutrophils activation (NE, MPO) and NETs (H3cit) formation assessed. Results All animals survived with no complications. DNase1 treatment led to a significantly improved scar appearance in both groups, which was also seen in Pad4-KO mice. In the laparotomy group DNase1 improved collagen deposition and fibrin concentration was significantly reduced by DNase1 treatment. Markers of neutrophil activation were significantly reduced in the treatment and Pad4-KO group. In the thermal injury group wound closure time was significantly reduced after DNase1 treatment and in the Pad4-KO group. Even though inflammation remained high in the thermal injury model over time, neutrophil activation and NETs formation were significantly reduced by DNase1 treatment compared to controls. Discussion Primary and secondary intention wound healing is improved by targeting NETs through DNase1 treatment or genetic KO, as assessed by wound closure time and scar appearances. Additionally, wound stability was not affected by DNASE treatment. The results suggest that overall wound healing is accelerated and DNase1 appears to be a promising option to reduce scar formation; which should be evaluated in humans.",Semantic Scholar,1,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,wound_assessment,none,4.0
,10.1111/j.1524-475x.2006.00175.x,Guidelines for the treatment of pressure ulcers,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2006.0,"Health care providers face the challenge of providing effective care for increasing numbers of patients with chronic wounds. Pressure ulcers, one type of chronic wound, are estimated to affect 1.3–3 million individuals in the United States.1 Prevalence varies among specific clinical populations, with higher percentages reported for the elderly, the acutely ill, and those who have sustained spinal cord injuries.2,3,4 The first comprehensive clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with pressure ulcers were published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in 1994. Since that time, a number of professional groups have also developed and published guidelines. The acceptance and adoption of guideline recommendations in practice is variable and influenced by several factors, including (1) guideline currency with the most recent and comprehensive evidence, (2) recognition and acceptance of guideline validity, (3) breadth of interprofessional representation in guideline development, and (4) guideline presentation and format.5 These issues pertain to guidelines in general, but are also applicable to those specific to chronic wounds. Despite many recent advances in wound care, the challenge of managing chronic wounds remains compounded by the current lack of consensus on clearly defined, comprehensive wound care principles and uniformly accepted analytical methods to evaluate outcomes. With these concerns in mind, the following guidelines were developed to facilitate use by multiple groups in the wound care community of clinicians, researchers, industry, governing agencies, and third-party payers. The guidelines provide recommendations for treatment of pressure ulcers supported by current evidence. However, treatment decisions also depend on specific patient characteristics, pressure ulcer characteristics/stage, patient circumstances, and overall goals. The development of a treatment plan of care begins with the determination of the goals of therapy. In most cases, the goal of therapy is to produce complete healing with restoration of functional skin integrity to the highest extent possible. However, in certain cases, the goal of therapy may not be complete healing of the wound. For example, in patients who are terminally ill, the goal of therapy may be palliative and focused on reducing discomfort or deterioration of the pressure ulcer, rather than complete healing of the wound. In other cases, the treatment may produce added discomfort or increased risk to the patient. Individual evaluation of each case is necessary within the context of the optimum outcome for that patient. The specific objectives of this project were to: Develop comprehensive, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines for pressure ulcer treatment. Present these guidelines in a clear, simple format designed to enable health care providers to make informed, evidence-supported treatment decisions to manage pressure ulcers appropriately. A search of health care databases for current published evidence-based guidelines addressing the treatment of pressure ulcers was conducted between July 2004 and January 2006 using electronic and online resources. In addition to published guidelines, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were reviewed for evidence on pressure ulcer treatment. The following guidelines were located and reviewed by the panel and used in the development of the categories of treatment and individual guidelines.

Usual care of a PrU is designed to promote healing; however, healing or closing the ulcer in patients receiving palliative care is often improbable. Therefore, the focus of care is better directed to reduce or eliminate pain, odor, and infection and allow for an environment that can promote ulcer closure, as well as improve self-image to help prevent social isolation. Healthcare providers also need to advocate for and develop products that control complications and deliver symptomatic relief to promote a desirable quality of life of the patient and family.2,22 The purpose of this white paper is to review and summarize the current scientific evidence for prevention and care of a PrU in a palliative care patient. Although randomized controlled studies are few, a moderately sufficient informed clinical consensus, as well as less rigorous scientific studies, does exist to support a variety of care approaches for the palliative individual with a PrU. Gaps in the literature will be identified, and current recommendations for practice will also be reviewed. The recommendations presented are those included in the 2009 National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP)-European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) International Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Treatment Guidelines.23 DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR RECOMMENDATIONS The recommendations in this paper are taken from the 2009 NPUAP-EPUAP Pressure Ulcer Treatment Guidelines.23 The guidelines were developed following a systematic, comprehensive review of the peer-reviewed and published research on PrU prevention and treatment from 1998 through January 2008, as well as supplemental searches. Evidence tables from previous guidelines were reviewed to identify relevant studies published before 1998. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed for quality, summarized in evidence tables, and classified according to their level of evidence using a schema developed by Sackett (Table 1).24Table 1: SACKETT LEVEL OF EVIDENCE RATING SYSTEM FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDIESSTRENGTH OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTING EACH RECOMMENDATION Once the recommendation was made, the cumulative strength of evidence supporting each recommendation was rated according to the following criteria: A-Recommendation supported by direct scientific evidencefrom properly designed and implemented controlled trials on PrUs in humans providing statistical results that consistently support the recommendation (Sackett level I studies). B-Recommendation supported by direct scientific evidence from properly designed and implemented clinical series in humans providing statistical results that consistently support the recommendation (Sackett levels II, III, IV, V studies). C-Recommendation supported by expert opinion or indirect evidence (eg, studies in animal models and/or other types of chronic wounds). More detailed information on the NPUAP-EPUAP guideline development methodology has been previously published.25 PRESSURE ULCER RISK Individuals with advanced or terminal disease are at significant risk for soft tissue ulceration.9,14,26-30 Significant PrUs can develop and reach Stages III and IV.31 In 1 study, the majority of PrUs in a hospice sample occurred in the 2 weeks before death,32 not unexpected as body systems physiologically begin to shut down 10 to 14 days prior to death.33 A variety of risk factors exist that place the palliative care individual at increased risk for both PrU development and nonhealing. Although the risk profile is not unique when compared with other patient groups, the ability to mediate the risk is often limited. Reifsnyder et al34 studied 980 hospice patients and found that, while 62.3% had a cancer diagnosis, those with a noncancer diagnosis were more likely to develop a PrU. Advanced Age. Increasing age has been found to be significantly associated with PrU development in hospice patients.14,35 The skin of older patients is drier, fragile, and easily injured,14,27 and injured skin is more vulnerable to ulceration. The epidermis thins and cell turnover slows, with cell loss occurring more rapidly than cell replacement.36 Protective function of the epidermis is compromised. In addition, temperature control is lessened with the loss of sweat glands, and collagen renewal deteriorates with age.37 Emollients are helpful for dry skin.38,39 Protein-Calorie Malnutrition. Older individuals are at risk for protein-calorie malnutrition, with the prevalence for older adults in long-term care ranging from 50% to 85%, as compared with 40% to 60% in acute care.40,41 Even if malnutrition is not formally diagnosed, lean body mass was associated with PrU development in a group of 98 hospice patients.14 Catabolism is also common in this patient group, a consequence of a constellation of cachexia, weakness, debilitation, weight loss, and muscle atrophy. The loss of body fat reserves reduces the natural padding over bones, increasing the vulnerability to pressure and soft tissue breakdown. Inadequate nutrition is associated with PrU development.14,31,35,42,43 A large, retrospective cohort study of 2420 adult nursing home residents, with a stay of 14 or more days, and with a risk of developing a PrU, documented that an unintentional weight loss at any body mass index increased the chance of developing a PrU by 147%.43 A state of compromised nutrition, such as unintentional weight loss, undernutrition, protein energy malnutrition, and dehydration deficits, is also a known risk factor for PrU development.44,45 Other nutritional indicators predictive of PrU development include anemia, low serum albumin, and weight loss.46-52 Although serum albumin levels have long been used clinically, they are a poor indicator of visceral protein status related to albumin's long half-life (12-21 days) and numerous factors that decrease albumin levels even in the presence of adequate protein intake.

Multiple comorbidities as well as age, malnutrition, compromised mobility, and the patient and family's right to make informed choices about care may present clinicians with significant challenges to prevent or heal these wounds. Prevention is the best strategy whenever possible, but there are circumstances when unavoidable pressure ulcers may develop. This article introduces clinicians to assessment tools to assist in identifying patients who are at greater risk for developing unavoidable pressure ulcers as well as those whose wounds are unlikely to heal. Developing agency policy and procedures to reflect a holistic integrated approach to palliative wound management for this population, centered on patient and family goals, can promote quality of life for the patient, while maintaining wound bed stabilization. Pressure Ulcers: An Overview Pressure ulcers are defined by The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel as localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear and/or friction (NPUAP, 2007). Sustained pressure on areas that support the body leads to restricted blood flow, and lack of oxygen eventually leads to ischemia, cell death, and tissue necrosis of the skin and underlying structures (Pieper, 2007). Pressure ulcers are classified in stages defined by the visible layers of tissue damaged from the surface toward the bone, and in 2007, NPUAP added 2 more stages: deep tissue injury and unstageable (Figure 1).Figure 1: Pressure ulcer stages revised by NPUAP. Reprinted with permission from NPUAP 2007, http://www.npuap.org/pr2.htm.Incidence and prevalence rates vary by patient population and clinical setting and exact figures are unknown. Surveys performed between 1990 and 2000 found the prevalence of pressure ulcers among the hospice population ranged from 14% to 28% (Cuddigan et al., 2001). Severe wounds can be significantly more expensive to manage and may require more frequent skilled nursing visits and impose a significant burden on the patient and family, requiring substantial caregiver time. The human cost in pain, suffering, and quality of life is even greater. Until recently, it was a common misconception that pressure ulcers were preventable with the application of vigilant staff interventions (Ayello & Lyder, 2008). It is now recognized that there are patient circumstances that create unavoidable pressure ulcers. In 2010, NPUAP released a statement defining unavoidable to mean ""that the individual developed a pressure ulcer even though the provider had evaluated the individual's clinical condition and pressure ulcer risk factors; defined and implemented interventions that are consistent with individual needs goals and recognized standards of practice; monitored and evaluated the impact of the interventions; and revised the approaches as appropriate.""FigureInterestingly, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, whose directives are the foundation for the majority of state healthcare regulations, contain new, more detailed wording to define whether a pressure ulcer was avoidable or unavoidable in long-term-care facilities (Stokowski, 2010). There are detailed guidelines for surveyors sent by the State's Department of Health to investigate whether the nursing home is following Federal Regulations for pressure ulcer prevention, treatment, and care planning to determine whether citations should be issued. This can be confusing when a nursing facility is a hospice patient's home. Nursing homes may have protocols in place for positioning, nutritional supplements, sharp or chemical debridement, or frequent wound care that may not be comfortable or appropriate for hospice patients. The nursing home and hospice staff must jointly coordinate, establish, and agree upon one plan of care that is consistent with the hospice philosophy of palliative care, and is based on the patient's needs and wishes (Figure 2). Since nursing home staff and attending physicians possess varying knowledge regarding palliative care and end-of-life symptom management, communication and ongoing education on end-of-life care can help ensure the highest quality of life and elimination of unnecessary procedures for hospice patients in the nursing home.Figure 2: Nursing Facility Hospice CarePalliative Care and Holistic Assessment The World Health Organization defines palliative care as ""the active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment. The goal of palliative care is achievement of the best quality of life for patients and their families"" (WHO, 2002). Hospice care is only one model of palliative medicine. It is not necessary for a patient to be in a hospice program to receive palliative care. When palliative care is the guiding philosophy, particular attention is given to the prevention, assessment, and treatment of pain and other symptoms, and to the provision of psychological, spiritual, and emotional support as determined by the patient and family. Within that foundation is the concept that the patient and family define dignity, comfort, and quality of life based on their personal values, cultures, wishes, and needs. Each step in the care plan process—assessment, goal setting, interventions, and evaluations—involves a collaborative approach that includes a multidisciplinary team and the patient and family. Within this process, a social worker conducts a psychosocial assessment. This will include an evaluation of lifestyle goals and values, cognitive function, communication ability, learning style, social functioning and support, and spiritual needs. She will also evaluate the patient and family's willingness and ability to adhere to an individualized treatment plan. A nurse evaluates the patient's medical and surgical history, lab results, and medication use. A standardized scale is used to assess pain, including wound-related pain. The patient is evaluated for mobility, physical functioning, and their ability to perform activities of daily living. A system review, physical assessment, and skin inspection for existing pressure ulcers provides information on comorbidities that can place a patient at risk for pressure ulcer development or impaired healing. A validated risk assessment tool can help clinicians identify factors that place patients at highest risk for pressure ulcers. Although none have been clinically evaluated for the palliative care population, one analysis, after a review of 33 studies of risk assessment scales, found the Braden scale to have the best predictability of pressure ulcer risk and was better than nurse's clinical judgment (Pancorbo-Hidalgo et",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

These cells are activated by fibrogenic cytokines such as TGF-β1, angiotensin II, and leptin. Reversibility of advanced liver fibrosis in patients has been recently documented, which has stimulated researchers to develop antifibrotic drugs. Emerging antifibrotic therapies are aimed at inhibiting the accumulation of fibrogenic cells and/or preventing the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins.

,10.4103/2229-5178.137828,Quality of life: Venous leg ulcers,Indian Dermatology Online Journal,2014.0,"BACKGROUND Leg ulcers are one of those conditions wherein the patient distress is in much greater proportions to than what meets the eye on examination. Venous leg ulcers represent more than 80% of all chronic leg ulcers and chronic venous leg ulceration (CVLU) results in a significant decline in health related quality of life (HRQoL) for the patient. Hence, it is essential that the care delivered focuses on the factors that affect the HRQoL of the sufferer, in addition to the factors concentrating on the wound management. A holistic assessment of the needs of these patients suffering from CVLU is therefore recommended for optimal and cost-effective management.[1] FACTORS DETERMINING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN LEG ULCERATION Various factors play a role in determining the quality of life in leg ulceration. These factors relate to physical functioning, psychosocial functioning, and treatment aspects. Physical factors include pain, exudate and odor pertaining to the ulcer; effect on mobility, sleep and routine daily activities. Irrespective of the study design, pain emerged as the most significant factor affecting HRQoL (Level B).[1] The chronic nature of leg ulcers, irrespective of the etiology is responsible for the various psychosocial and treatment aspects. Psychosocial parameters include social isolation, depression, feelings of regret, loss of power, and helplessness. Various studies have pointed out that patients with chronic wounds of the lower extremity often experience functional disability and emotional distress, which negatively affects patient quality of life, hence incorporating HRQoL measurements in clinical practice may improve understanding of chronic wound patients' healthcare needs.[2] The treatment parameters include efficacy of treatment with respect to improvement of the wound, time taken for healing and cost-effectiveness of the therapy. In addition, the quality of life is also determined by the patient's concepts regarding wound hygiene, dressing and nursing care; and the quality of care being provided to them.[3] QUALITY OF LIFE INDICES/INSTRUMENTS Health-related quality of life can be defined as ""the functional effect of an illness and its consequent therapy upon a patient, as perceived by the patient.""[4] Various generic and specific instruments have been used to evaluate QoL in leg ulcer patients. Pain scales have also been used in several studies, together with HRQoL instruments. An integrative review has been performed to analyze various generic and specific instruments (Level A).[5] A brief outline of the various indices commonly used in leg ulcers has been outlined in Table 1.Table 1: Generic and Specific Indices/Instruments to evaluate quality of lifeGeneric tools are widely available in various languages and have been frequently used since they are the most validated. Short form 36 (SF-36) and its adaptations are useful for establishing HRQoL in people with VLU compared with the general population. However, the responsiveness of the SF-36 to changes in wound status is unclear.[6] EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) is effective for economic and cost-effectiveness analysis.[5] The generic tools have consistently demonstrated pain to be a significant problem for leg ulcer patients but are unable to accurately differentiate between pain that is directly related to leg ulceration and that experienced owing to comorbidities (Level B).[7] Hence, many studies incorporate generic tools along with pain scales for assessment. Generic instruments are also unable to identify changes in VLU in relation to the wound characteristics and its consequences, such as chronicity, recurrence, course of the disease, pain, odor, edema, exudation, mobility limitation, physical appearance, emotional, and social aspects and the effect of these on HRQoL measurement (Level B).[45] Specific tools have therefore been developed and these contribute to establishing clinical care based on individual needs. Hyland and Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule (CWIS) are applicable to all leg ulcers; whereas the other specific tools outlined in Table 1 are used for venous leg ulcers. Hyland has good reliability and ability to discriminate changes in VLU patients, by age, mobility, size, and duration of VLU, but is not a good tool to assess treatment responsiveness (Level C).[68] The CWIS is a good HRQoL measurement instrument for chronic wounds in general and can differentiate well between healed and non-healed states (Level C).[9] Of the various specific tools, Charing Cross Venous Leg Ulcer (CCVLU) Questionnaire has a high reliability, validity and responsiveness and shows good correlation with SF-36 (Level B).[10] It is the most appropriate instrument for use with VLU patients, due to its disease-specific psychometric characteristics (Level B).[45] Two new specific scores (SPVLU-5D and VLU-QoL) have shown great promise in measuring HRQoL in VLU patients, although more research is needed to establish their specific reliability and validity (Level C).[5] A combination of generic and disease-specific QoL indices should be a standard measure in patients with chronic venous disease.[4] DEVELOPMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX The implementation of a QoL index depends on the ease of application and the time taken for calculation. An ideal index should have high sensitivity and specificity. Larger number of questions increases the sensitivity but takes a lot of time; whereas lesser number of questions provides ease of implementation at the cost of sensitivity. It is important to assess the psychometric parameters of a QoL index by its reliability and validity. The process of development and validation of the specific measure CCVLU has been reviewed and the full text article is available online (Level B).[10] A validation study with two generic HRQoL indices (SF-12 and EQ-5D) and one specific CVLU (Hyland) validation study extending over a 1 year period has compared their discriminative and responsive characteristics (Level C).[6] A VLU specific tool Freiburg Life Quality Assessment (German language questionnaire) was developed and validated and found suitable to assess QoL in both course and cross sectional studies (Level C).[11] Similarly, tools can be developed, translated into various languages with validation to suit the regional needs in the Indian context. IMPLICATIONS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AND RESEARCH Quality of life indices in CVLU have been used in various clinical settings and are usually administered at intervals of 0, 3, 6, and 12 months.

,10.5326/0460285,AAHA Nutritional Assessment Guidelines for Dogs and Cats,Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association,2010.0,"The American Animal Hospital Association recommends these nutritional assessment guidelines because good nutrition enhances pets’ quality and quantity of life, and is integral to optimal animal care. Incorporating nutritional assessment into regular animal care is critical for maintaining pets’ health, as well as their response to disease and injury. It requires little to no additional time or cost.The specific goals of this article are to provide:The positive impact of proper nutrition on health and disease is well established in all animals. Appropriate feeding throughout all life stages can help prevent diet-associated diseases, as well as to assist in the management of other diseases. For example, diets formulated for dogs and cats with chronic kidney disease have been shown to provide significant benefits.1,2,3The National Research Council (NRC) of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences is the leading provider of nutrient recommendations for dogs and cats.4 The NRC publications form the basis for Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) nutrient profiles, which are updated routinely.5 AAFCO provides a mechanism for developing and implementing uniform and equitable laws, regulations, standards and enforcement policies, and establishes nutrient profiles for cat and dog foods.Assurance of proper nutritional health, however, entails more than meeting nutrient profiles; additional factors must be considered. Figure 1 represents the “Circle of Nutrition,” symbolizing the comprehensive approach to clinical nutrition used by the American College of Veterinary Nutrition (ACVN).According to this approach, nutritional assessment considers several factors that are described in detail in this document. An iterative process, in which each factor affecting the animal’s nutritional status is assessed and reassessed as often as required, provides a thorough nutritional assessment of the small animal.6,7,8 The factors to be evaluated include the animal, the diet, feeding management and environmental factors, as described below.Animal-specific factors include the age, physiological status and activity of the pet. Problems related to animal factors are referred to as nutrient-sensitive disorders (e.g., intolerances, allergies and organ-specific diseases). Diet choice for these animals should be restricted to those formulated to meet the disease-associated nutritional limitations of the specific animal.Diet-specific factors include the safety and appropriateness of the diet fed to the animal in question. Problems related to diet factors are referred to as diet-induced disorders (e.g., nutrient imbalances, spoilage, contamination, adulteration). Animals with these disorders may be treated by feeding a diet known to be appropriate for the animal.Feeding factors include the frequency, timing, location and method of feeding, whereas environmental factors include space and quality of the pet’s surroundings. Problems related to feeding and environmental factors are referred to as feeding-related and environment-related disorders (e.g., over- or underfeeding, excessive use of treats, poor husbandry, competitive eating in dogs, and lack of appropriate environmental stimulation). These situations require effective communications to produce the appropriate behavioral changes in the client.Nutritional assessment is a two-part process.The interview portion of the evaluation should be performed by a person trained to elicit required information from the caregiver most knowledgeable about the pet(s). A detailed nutritional history should be obtained. A variety of forms are available for recording these findings.9,10Nutritional screening is part of routine history taking and physical examination of every animal. Information collected should include assessment of each of the parameters of the circle of nutrition.Certain life factors, by themselves, may not call for an extended evaluation if the animal is otherwise healthy. Low or high activity level, multiple pets in the home, gestation, lactation, or age &lt;1 year or &gt;7 years, all create a need for closer scrutiny. Although these factors by themselves may not trigger an extended evaluation, they should cause the veterinarian to scrutinize the pet’s situation more closely.Specific risk factors known to influence nutritional status include those listed in Table 2. When features are identified that raise one’s “index of suspicion” for a nutrition-related problem, an extended nutritional evaluation may be indicated.The value of an extended nutritional evaluation increases as the number of risk factors and their severity increase. Moreover, sufficient concern about any one parameter may be enough to warrant extended evaluation.If no concerns are raised by the screening evaluation, then the nutritional assessment is complete.Use a consistent method and scale to measure body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS) and muscle condition score (MCS) to assess current status and changes over time. Although different scoring systems may have situation-specific merits, the panel recommends that practices choose, and all doctors and staff consistently use, one system and record the total points on which it is based (i.e., the denominator).The BCS evaluates body fat [Figure 2]. Various BCS systems are used to evaluate dogs and cats (e.g., scales of 5, 6, 7 or 9).11,12,13The goal for most pets is a BCS of 2.5–3 of 5, or 4–5 of 9. (This may appear too thin to some pet owners, so client education is important.) These BCS goals are based on a limited number of studies in dogs and cats14,15,16,17 as well as those from other species. Disease risk associations with higher BCS in adult animals appear to increase above 3.5 of 5 (6 of 9). Similar risk associations for other life stages in client-owned pets have not been reported, but may occur at low BCS based on studies of laboratory-housed animals, and in humans.16,18 Additional research on dogs and cats is needed to more fully evaluate the effects of body condition on disease prevention.The MCS differs from the BCS in that it evaluates muscle mass [Figure 3]. Evaluation of muscle mass includes visual examination and palpation over the temporal bones, scapulae, lumbar vertebrae and pelvic bones. Assessing muscle condition is important because muscle loss is greater in animals with most acute and chronic diseases (i.e., stressed starvation) compared to healthy animals deprived of food, when primarily fat is lost (i.e., simple starvation). Muscle loss adversely affects strength, immune function, and wound healing and is independently associated with mortality in humans.19,20A simple MCS scale is currently undergoing development and validation.21 The authors’ clinical experience suggests that early identification of subtle muscle loss, at the “mild muscle wasting” stage, is",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,7.0

It was the intent of the original authors that patients with diabetes be excluded or analyzed separately. The Fontaine and Rutherford Systems have been used to classify risk of amputation and likelihood of benefit from revascularization by subcategorizing patients into two groups: ischemic rest pain and tissue loss. Due to demographic shifts over the last 40 years, especially a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes mellitus and rapidly expanding techniques of revascularization, it has become increasingly difficult to perform meaningful outcomes analysis for patients with threatened limbs using these existing classification systems. Particularly in patients with diabetes, limb threat is part of a broad disease spectrum. Perfusion is only one determinant of outcome; wound extent and the presence and severity of infection also greatly impact the threat to a limb. Therefore, the Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Guidelines Committee undertook the task of creating a new classification of the threatened lower extremity that reflects these important considerations. We term this new framework, the Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Threatened Limb Classification System.

Some of the passages were taken from the previous version [1]. This is the short version of the guideline. The long version can be accessed at www.awmf.org. It contains additional information e.g. on the expert committee, on use, scope and objectives, on financing, implementation and dissemination as well as management of conflicts of interest, a clinical introduction, and case reports. The terms and symbols listed in Table 1 were used to offer standardized recommendations. Hypertrophic scars and keloids are basically benign skin lesions. Any need for treatment is determined by the symptoms (e.g. pruritus/pain), by functional impairment (e.g. contraction/mechanical irritation due to elevation) or can be rationalized on aesthetic/cosmetic grounds, when a significant impact on quality of life and stigmatization can be foreseen [2]. Bock et al. developed an instrument to assess quality of life specifically for patients with hypertrophic scars and keloids. In their validation study, a severe impairment of quality of life was observed [3]. Therapeutic goals must be set on an individual basis; the main consideration is to alleviate the patient’s complaints. Depending on the method chosen, a clear improvement (e.g. volume reduction by 30–50 %, decrease of symptoms > 50 %, and/or sufficient patient satisfaction) should be achieved after 3–6 treatment sessions or after 3–6 months of therapy. None of the currently available methods for scar therapy can guarantee scar reduction or an improvement of the functional and/or cosmetic situation in all cases. The treatment method of first choice cannot be standardized for scars, as too many variables influence their development and regression (e.g. location, age and type of the scar, genetic predisposition). A combination of various treatment methods is often required to achieve success. The main methods for documentation in day-to-day practice include documentation of size and thickness and photographs. Patient satisfaction and reduction of symptoms are further important considerations. Clinical studies currently use scales such as the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), two-dimensional keloid modeling as well as mid- to high resolution B-image sonography. Subjective assessment scales are, however, of only limited use for large scars or for evaluating functional impact [4-6]. 3D imaging is also used, in particular for clinical studies. Algorithms for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids are depicted in Figures 1-3. Glucocorticoids (aka glucocorticosteroids) reduce excessive scar growth by decreasing the synthesis of collagen and glycosaminoglycans, and inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. In addition to the known anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids, they also inhibit iNOS transcription (iNOS, inducible form of NO synthase [7]) thus reducing collagen production in fibroblasts and inhibiting synthesis of alpha-2-macroglobulin, a collagenase inhibitor. The injections are painful. If the injection is too deep, atrophy of the subcutis may develop; if the injection is too superficial, telangiectasias and disturbed pigmentation may ensue. Whitish deposits of the crystal suspension may also occur. Most commonly, triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) is used at a dose of 10–40 mg, at most 5 mg/cm2. It can be injected as is, or diluted 1 : 2 to 1 : 4 with either NaCl 0.9 % or lidocaine. The injection must be administered in a strictly intralesional manner with a syringe that should ideally have a locking needle (Luer system). Blanching of the injected tissue indicates that infiltration is complete. Repeat injections may be administered at three to four week intervals if required. One study showed that starting with a low concentration of triamcinolone (10 mg/ml) and increasing it over time (to 20 mg/ml resp. 40 mg/ml) may reduce the risk of possible side effects and the relapse rate [8]. Superficial spray cryosurgery immediately prior to the intralesional glucocorticoid injection causes edema and facilitates infiltration [9]; it also reduces pain. As a preventative measure, injection of 1 mg triamcinolone per centimeter directly into the wound margins during surgery has shown good efficacy without topical side effects [10]. Treatment success is most likely if active scars – i.e. bright red, or subjectively symptomatic (pruritic or painful) – are treated with TAC. This is based on the mechanism of action. If there is no improvement after three therapy sessions with triamcinolone, the treatment regimen should be adapted, for example by combining it with 5-fluorouracil. Efficacy of triamcinolone acetonide in keloid treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Wong TS et al. Front Med (Lausanne) 2016; 3: 71. The effect is based mainly on changes in microcirculation with cold-induced alteration, thrombosis and consecutive ischemic cell death. Protracted healing time of about four weeks and frequent (reversible) depigmentation due to destruction of cold-sensitive melanocytes. In most cases, repeat procedures at intervals of 4–6 weeks are required until the scar has been sufficiently flattened. Due to its various limitations, intralesional cryosurgery is only infrequently used. The required needle is a single-use medical product; its cost presents a significant hurdle for the procedure, particularly on an out-patient basis. Depending on the size of the keloid, several needles may be required, and treatment of larger keloids is time-consuming. Under sterile conditions, nitrogen is instilled into the keloid via a double hollow needle after local anesthesia. The whole keloid is then frozen, with a halo of 3–5 mm around the lesion. Resolution of the keloid occurs within approximately four to six months (35). The patient should be advised to expect a blister progressing to a weeping wound; antiseptic treatment may be indicated. The next treatment session should take place only after healing of the defect caused by the previous treatment. Dark-skinned patients must also be warned of possible hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. Active keloids may worsen after spray cryosurgery, and in these cases, a combination e.g. with subsequent triamcinolone injections is helpful.

Depression in patients with chronic wounds is prevalent and often not communicated by patients themselves. Patient well-being is often overlooked in wound assessment protocols focused on the local wound bed only. Routine depression screening and evaluation of various psychosocial factors should be a part of assessment for all patients with chronic wounds. Wounds with a duration longer than 30 days are considered chronic. For example, diabetic foot ulcers comprise a large majority of these wounds and often exceed the expected 12-week healing period because of underlying factors that cannot be fully corrected.1 Patients with chronic wounds face considerable psychological stress because they need continuous medical care and frequent visits to healthcare facilities. The presence of these wounds significantly disrupts the daily life of patients, including changes in sleeping patterns, diet, and mobility. Loss of mobility may lead to feelings of loneliness, powerlessness, and dependency, as patients rely on family or friends to help fulfill their basic needs such as commuting, activities of daily living, and personal hygiene. Further, patients may experience chronic pain, exudate, and odor, which negatively impact social interactions, relationships, sexuality, and self-confidence. All of these psychosocial factors add up and may lead to a slow onset of anxiety and depression in patients with chronic wounds. Further, healthcare providers have a tendency to overlook the fact that these components have a direct effect on the ability of a wound to heal completely. The link between chronic wounds and depression was highlighted by House and Hughes2 in 1996. Numerous studies since then3,4 have confirmed that depression has adverse effects on wound healing outcomes. This is mostly attributed to poor adherence to treatment, resistance to lifestyle changes, and inadequate communication between the patient and provider regarding well-being. In particular, patient depression leads to pessimism regarding perceived treatment benefits and subsequently lowers self-efficacy. This vicious cycle may result in poor self-care and wound hygiene, as well as nonadherence to medication regimens or regular wound care requirements such as dressing changes.5 Healthcare providers involved in wound care are advised to adopt the biopsychosocial model6 and should be aware of the negative impact of social and psychological factors on wound healing.1 The biopsychosocial model, first proposed by George Engel7 in 1977, suggests that it is not sufficient to manage only biologic factors (wound/wound pathology); holistic treatment must also address the psychological factors (thoughts/emotions, distress, coping methods) and social factors (family circumstances, work issues, socioeconomic and cultural parameters) affecting the patient. An often-neglected part of chronic wound management is the assessment, evaluation, and management of depression in these patients. It is essential that providers are on the lookout for subtle signs of mood disorders (Table) and initiate a psychological assessment as part of the holistic management plan. Many well-validated and simple-to-administer depression rating scales exist; the Patient Health Questionnaire-98 is one option that is freely available to any healthcare provider (https://www.mdcalc.com/phq-9-patient-health-questionnaire-9). Table - SUBTLE SIGNS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN PATIENTS WITH WOUNDS Change Observation Mood and composure Sadness, visible tension, irritability, resistance to change Sleeping patterns Excessive sleep or lack of sleep, lethargic, slow reactions Eating habits Loss of appetite or sudden weight gain View of future Hopelessness; loss of interest, self-confidence, and/or joy; futile life outlook; and nonadherence to treatment Concentration Frequent memory lapses, difficulty in task completion Based on this assessment, patients with suspected depression should be referred for appropriate mental health interventions as part of the interprofessional team approach in the management of wounds. CONCLUSIONS Providers should help patients with chronic wounds understand that their wounds do not constitute a complete setback in life but represent a new challenge that requires adaptation. Although all change is difficult, professional assistance may be necessary for patient support and motivation to seek help, especially if the patient also has comorbid depression. Timely interventions for depression and other mental health issues will enhance outcomes for all patients with chronic wounds and are an integral part of the wound assessment process.",OpenAlex,2,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,wound_assessment,none,6.0
,10.1111/j.1524-475x.2006.00179.x,"Zinc in wound healing: Theoretical, experimental, and clinical aspects",Wound Repair and Regeneration,2007.0,"ABSTRACT Zinc is an essential trace element in the human body and its importance in health and disease is appreciated. It serves as a cofactor in numerous transcription factors and enzyme systems including zinc‐dependent matrix metalloproteinases that augment autodebridement and keratinocyte migration during wound repair. Zinc confers resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cytoprotection against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins possibly through antioxidant activity of the cysteine‐rich metallothioneins. Zinc deficiency of hereditary or dietary cause can lead to pathological changes and delayed wound healing. Oral zinc supplementation may be beneficial in treating zinc‐deficient leg ulcer patients, but its therapeutic place in surgical patients needs further clarification. Topical administration of zinc appears to be superior to oral therapy due to its action in reducing superinfections and necrotic material via enhanced local defense systems and collagenolytic activity, and the sustained release of zinc ions that stimulates epithelialization of wounds in normozincemic individuals. Zinc oxide in paste bandages (Unna boot) protects and soothes inflamed peri‐ulcer skin. Zinc is transported through the skin from these formulations, although the systemic effects seem insignificant. We present here the first comprehensive account of zinc in wound management in relation to current concepts of wound bed preparation and the wound‐healing cascade.

,10.1002/cncr.20162,Perspectives on cancer therapy-induced mucosal injury,Cancer,2004.0,"BACKGROUND A frequent complication of anticancer treatment, oral and gastrointestinal (GI) mucositis, threatens the effectiveness of therapy because it leads to dose reductions, increases healthcare costs, and impairs patients' quality of life. The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society for Oral Oncology assembled an international multidisciplinary panel of experts to create clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, evaluation, and treatment of mucositis. METHODS The panelists examined medical literature published from January 1966 through May 2002, presented their findings at two separate conferences, and then created a writing committee that produced two articles: the current study and another that codifies the clinical implications of the panel's findings in practice guidelines. RESULTS New evidence supports the view that oral mucositis is a complex process involving all the tissues and cellular elements of the mucosa. Other findings suggest that some aspects of mucositis risk may be determined genetically. GI proapoptotic and antiapoptotic gene levels change along the GI tract, perhaps explaining differences in the frequency with which mucositis occurs at different sites. Studies of mucositis incidence in clinical trials by quality and using meta-analysis techniques produced estimates of incidence that are presented herein for what to our knowledge may be a broader range of cancers than ever presented before. CONCLUSIONS Understanding the pathobiology of mucositis, its incidence, and scoring are essential for progress in research and care directed at this common side-effect of anticancer therapies.

In fact, mucosal healing has emerged as a key treatment goal in IBD that predicts sustained clinical remission and resection-free survival of patients. The structural basis of mucosal healing is an intact barrier function of the gut epithelium that prevents translocation of commensal bacteria into the mucosa and submucosa with subsequent immune cell activation. Thus, mucosal healing should be considered as an initial event in the suppression of inflammation of deeper layers of the bowel wall, rather than as a sign of complete healing of gut inflammation. In this systematic review, the clinical studies on mucosal healing are summarised and the effects of anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs such as 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine, ciclosporin and anti-TNF antibodies (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, infliximab) on mucosal healing are discussed.

Risk Indicators for Attachment Loss,Journal of Periodontology,1994.0,"S pecific risk indicators associated with either susceptibility or resistance to severe forms of periodontal disease were evaluated in a cross‐section of 1,426 subjects, 25 to 74 years of age, mostly metropolitan dwellers, residing in Erie County, New York, and surrounding areas. The study sample exhibited a wide range of periodontal disease experience defined by different levels of attachment loss. Therefore, it was possible to accurately assess associations between the extent of periodontal disease and patient characteristics including age, smoking, systemic diseases, exposure to occupational hazards, and subgingival microbial flora. Age was the factor most strongly associated with attachment loss, with odds ratios for subjects 35 to 44 years old ranging from 1.72 (95% CI: 1.18 to 2.49) to 9.01 (5.86 to 13.89) for subjects 65 to 74 years old. Diabetes mellitus was the only systemic disease positively associated with attachment loss with an odds ratio of 2.32 (95% CI: 1.17–4.60). Smoking had relative risks ranging from 2.05 (95% CI: 1.47–2.87) for light smokers increasing to 4.75 (95% CI: 3.28–6.91) for heavy smokers. The presence of two bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus , in the subgingival flora represented risks of 1.59 (95% CI: 1.11–2.25) and 2.45 (95% CI: 1.87–3.24), respectively. Our results show that age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and the presence of subgingival P. gingivalis and B. forsythus are risk indicators for attachment loss. These associations remain valid after controlling for gender, socioeconomic status, income, education, and oral hygiene status expressed in terms of supragingival plaque accumulation and subgingival calculus.

The four studies included a total of 922 patients with nonhealing lower extremity diabetic ulcers of at least 8 weeks' duration. Following initial complete sharp debridement of the ulcer, patients were randomized to receive a standardized regimen of good ulcer care alone, good ulcer care plus placebo gel, or good ulcer care plus becaplermin gel‐30 μg/g, or good ulcer care plus becaplermin gel‐100 μg/g, with various combinations of regimens used in the four studies. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events and by clinical laboratory evaluations. Meta‐analytic statistical techniques were used in the combined analysis to establish homogeneity of treatment comparisons across studies. Based on an analysis of patients with baseline ulcer area common to all trials (≤ 10 cm 2 ), representing 95% of all patients, becaplermin gel‐100 μg/g significantly increased ( p = 0.007) the probability of complete healing compared with placebo gel. It was determined that for the median ulcer area of these patients, which was 1.5 cm 2 , the becaplermin gel‐100 μg/g treatment group showed a 39% increase in complete healing compared with that of the placebo gel treatment group (50% vs. 36%, respectively, p = 0.007). Becaplermin gel‐100 μg/g significantly decreased ( p = 0.01) the time to complete healing compared with placebo gel, with the 35th percentile of time to complete healing being reduced by 30% (14.1 weeks vs. 20.1 weeks, respectively). In patients with ulcers ≤ 5 cm 2 at baseline (a more homogeneous group), becaplermin gel‐100 μg/g also significantly increased the incidence of complete healing with a similar decrease in the time to healing. Adverse events reported during treatment or during a 3‐month follow‐up period were not unexpected for this patient population and were similar in nature and incidence across all treatment groups.

Epidemiology of CANLittle information exists as to frequency of CAN in representative diabetic populations.This is further complicated by the differences in the methodology used and the lack of standardization.Fifteen studies using different end points report prevalence rates of 1% to 90%. 1 The heterogenous methodology makes it difficult to compare epidemiology across different studies.CAN may be present at diagnosis, and prevalence increases with age, duration of diabetes, and poor glycemic control.CAN also cosegregates with distal symmetric polyneuropathy, microangiopathy, and macroangiopathy.Age, diabetes, obesity, and smoking are risk factors for reduced heart rate variability (HRV) 5 in type 2 diabetes.Thus, there may be selectivity and sex-related differences among the various cardiovascular risk factors as to their influence on autonomic dysfunction. 6HbA1c, hypertension, distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, retinopathy, and exposure to hyperglycemia were shown to be risk factors for developing CAN in type 1 diabetes. 7 Clinical Manifestations of CAN Resting TachycardiaWhereas abnormalities in HRV are early findings of CAN, resting tachycardia and a fixed heart rate are characteristic late findings in diabetic patients with vagal impairment. 8esting heart rates of 90 to 100 bpm and occasional heart rate increments up to 130 bpm occur.The highest resting heart rates have been found in patients with parasympathetic damage, occurring earlier in the course of CAN than sympathetic nerve function; in those with evidence for combined vagal and sympathetic involvement, the rate returns toward normal but remains elevated.A fixed heart rate that is unresponsive to moderate exercise, stress, or sleep indicates almost complete cardiac denervation. 8Thus, heart rate may not provide a reliable diagnostic criterion of CAN in the absence of other causes unless it is increased by more than 100 bpm.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,3.0

This burden is also likely to increase with a larger proportion of elderly and increasing prevalence of life-style diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Reviews of the evidence on the burden of illness associated with chronic wounds have not been comprehensive in scope and have not provided an assessment of the distribution of the health care costs across categories of resource use. This study is a systematic review of multiple databases for studies on adult patients with chronic wounds and with the primary objective to assess the impact on health-related quality of life by category of ulcers, and associated direct and indirect costs. Eligible studies will primary be empirical studies evaluating, describing or comparing measurement of quality of life and economic impact. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts and select studies involving adults with chronic wounds. These investigators will also independently extract data using a pre-designed data extraction form. Differences in applied methodologies and uncertainties will clearly be accounted for. Conservative valuations of costs and impact on health-related quality of life will be prioritised. Variations that may depend on age distribution, the categorisation of ulcer, healthcare system etc. will be described clearly. The proposed systematic review will yield a comprehensive assessment of the humanistic and economic burden of chronic wounds in an adult population. A better understanding of the humanistic and economic burden of chronic wounds is essential for policy and planning purposes, to monitor trends in disease burden and not at least in order to estimate the real-world cost-effectiveness of new treatments and therapies.

CVI is characterized by symptoms or signs produced by venous hypertension as a result of structural or functional abnormalities of veins. The most frequent causes of CVI are primary abnormalities of the venous wall and the valves and secondary changes due to previous venous thrombosis that can lead to reflux, obstruction, or both. Because the history and clinical examination will not always indicate the nature and extent of the underlying abnormality (anatomic extent, pathology, and cause), a number of diagnostic investigations have been developed that can elucidate whether there is calf muscle pump dysfunction and determine the anatomic extent and severity of obstruction or reflux. The difficulty in deciding which investigations to use and how to interpret the results has stimulated the development of this consensus document. The aim of this document was to provide an account of these tests, with an outline of their usefulness and limitations and indications of which patients should be subjected to the tests and when and of what clinical decisions can be made. This document was written primarily for the clinician who would like to learn the latest approaches to the investigation of patients with CVI and the new applications that have emerged from recent research, as well as for the novice who is embarking on venous research. Care has been taken to indicate which methods have entered the clinical arena and which are mainly used for research. The foundation for this consensus document was laid by the faculty at a meeting held under the auspices of the American Venous Forum, the Cardiovascular Disease Educational and Research Trust, the European Society of Vascular Surgery, the International Angiology Scientific Activity Congress Organization, the International Union of Angiology, and the Union Internationale de Phlebologie at the Abbaye des Vaux de Cernay, France, on March 5 to 9, 1997.

This experience is commonly perceived as a chronic stressor, and caregivers often experience negative psychological, behavioral, and physiological effects on their daily lives and health. In this report, we describe the experience of a 53-year-old woman who is the sole caregiver for her husband, who has acute myelogenous leukemia and was undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. During his intense and unpredictable course, the caregiver's burden is complex and complicated by multiple competing priorities. Because caregivers are often faced with multiple concurrent stressful events and extended, unrelenting stress, they may experience negative health effects, mediated in part by immune and autonomic dysregulation. Physicians and their interdisciplinary teams are presented daily with individuals providing such care and have opportunity to intervene.

,10.1016/j.whi.2018.11.003,From Treatment to Healing: Inquiry and Response to Recent and Past Trauma in Adult Health Care,Women s Health Issues,2018.0,"In 2015, a national working group developed and published a conceptual framework for trauma-informed primary care (Machtinger et al., 2015Machtinger E.L. Cuca Y.P. Khanna N. Rose C.D. Kimberg L.S. From treatment to healing: the promise of trauma-informed primary care.Womens Health Issues. 2015; 25: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Since that publication, there has been increasing recognition that childhood and adult trauma underlie and perpetuate many physical and behavioral health conditions seen in health care settings and that addressing trauma could fundamentally improve the experience and efficacy of care for both patients and providers. A number of high-level efforts are currently under way to translate trauma-informed principles and frameworks into practical guidance for health care providers and practices (e.g., clinics and offices), including comprehensive endeavors by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Council for Behavioral Health. The original 2015 conceptual framework focused on adult primary care. Since that time, it has become clear that the model applies equally well to a wide variety of other adult health care specialties in which trauma is known to affect the experiences and outcomes of care. These include obstetrics and gynecology, rheumatology, neurology, infectious disease, geriatrics, palliative care, and many other medical and surgical specialties. As such, the framework is now referred to as trauma-informed health care (Figure 1). Trauma-informed health care has five core components: a foundation grounded in trauma-informed principles and a team approach; an environment that is calm, safe, and empowering; education about the impacts of current and past trauma on health; and inquiry about and response to recent and past trauma that includes onsite or community-based resources and treatments. A more detailed description of each of these components can be found in the original article (Machtinger et al., 2015Machtinger E.L. Cuca Y.P. Khanna N. Rose C.D. Kimberg L.S. From treatment to healing: the promise of trauma-informed primary care.Womens Health Issues. 2015; 25: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Herein, we provide guidance for adult health care providers and practices about how to inquire about and respond to recent and past trauma as a way of more effectively addressing many common health problems. Although these two components of trauma-informed health care are the focus of this article, we also recommend that providers and practices take certain key preparatory steps that are necessary to lay the foundation for trauma inquiry and response. First, recognize that trauma is common. Many people have experienced childhood and/or adult trauma that has a lasting impact on their mental and physical health (Black et al., 2011Black M.C. Basile K.C. Breiding M.J. Smith S.G. Walters M.L. Merrick M.T. Stevens M.R. The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 summary report.

Understanding this impact helps to clarify why some conditions remain refractory to traditional therapies and why some patients seem to be hard to engage, defensive, demanding, or ""on edge."" This understanding informs a fundamental shift in the way each person on the health care team (providers and staff) thinks about patients, from ""What is wrong with you?"" to ""What has happened to you?"" Ultimately, this trauma-informed perspective helps the health care team to sustain a compassionate and patient-centered approach and develop more satisfying relationships and more effective treatment plans with patients. Next, adopt trauma-informed principles. Trauma can damage a person's sense of safety and trust and can adversely affect relationships. To provide a healing environment for both patients and the health care team, integrate trauma-informed principles into your practice (safety, trustworthiness, collaboration, peer support, empowerment, and cultural humility and responsiveness; Reyes, 2017Reyes L. Trauma-Informed Systems (TIS) Healing Ourselves, Our Communities and Our City: Program overview. Department of Public Health, San Francisco2017http://traumatransformed.org/wp-content/uploads/TIS-Program-Overview-11-15-17.pdfGoogle Scholar, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 2014Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA's concept of trauma and guidance for a trauma-informed approach. HHS Publication No. (SMA) 14-4884. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Rockville, MD2014https://store.samhsa.gov/system/files/sma14-4884.pdfGoogle Scholar). Then, offer education and resources for patients, staff, and providers. Educate all patients, staff, and providers about the connections between trauma, health, and health-related behaviors. Understand that patients may not disclose trauma for many reasons, including shame and fear. Recognize that health care staff and providers may also have suffered traumatic life experiences and can experience vicarious trauma. Supportive responses for staff and providers include regular interdisciplinary team meetings to decrease isolation, supporting opportunities for self-care, and facilitating access to employee support services available in many institutions. Thereafter, establish referral processes for patients wanting further service and/or treatment. Having referral processes in place increases provider comfort when asking about trauma and facilitates referrals to onsite or community-based services that are trauma-informed and that match the patient's needs, desires, and readiness. Integrating behavioral health providers into primary care and medical subspecialties greatly facilitates this process. Establishing referrals to address other social determinants of health such as housing and food insecurity can also contribute to reducing the incidence and adverse impacts of trauma. Providers and staff can embrace techniques that greatly facilitate inquiry about and response to trauma. We suggest using the ""4 Cs"" (Kimberg, 2016Kimberg L.

Novel Polygalacturonic and Caprylic Acid (PG+CAP) Antimicrobial Wound Ointment is Effective in Managing Microbially Contaminated Chronic Wounds in a Pilot Prospective Randomized Clinical Study,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,2023.0,"Abstract Background The use of antibiotics and antiseptics in the management of biofilm colonized chronic wounds is not fully effective in eradicating multidrug-resistant organisms. We developed PG+CAP ointment combining naturally derived agents commonly used in skin care and showed in our in vitro study that PG-+CAP combination ointment could rapidly eradicate gram positive, gram negative and fungal organisms embedded in biofilm within 1 hour. Furthermore, in a full thickness, microbially contaminated swine wound model study we found that with daily ointment application, PG+CAP ointment was significantly better at healing wounds at 2 weeks compared to MediHoney and was also significantly better at eradicating microbes colonizing wound tissues. In this current pilot human study, we compared PG+CAP ointment to MediHoney at three international centers. Methods This is a multicenter prospective randomized open label comparative study where patients with chronic full-thickness wounds at three academic international medical centers (American University of Beirut and Lebanese American University, Lebanon and Albert Einstein Medical Center, Brazil) were randomized to a daily treatment with either PG+CAP ointment or MediHoney. Clinical and wound assessments were obtained weekly up to 6 weeks. Full improvement was defined as 50% or greater decrease in wound size and/or a 75% or greater re-epithelialization and granulation of the wound with no necrosis or related adverse events (AEs) or sepsis. The validated Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) score was used to track wound healing. Results A total of 20 patients with chronic wounds were included (10 patients in each arm). Age and clinical characteristics were comparable in both groups. Diabetes mellitus tended to occur more frequently in the PG+CAP arm (See Table 1-P=0.06). Full improvement/healing occurred in all patients (100%) randomized to PG+CAP with no AEs vs 70% full improvement in the MediHoney arm. Patients who received PG+CAP had more than two-fold wound improvement in terms of their PUSH scores compared to MediHoney:Table 1.Characteristics &amp; Outcomes Conclusion Based on preliminary data from this prospective randomized multicenter trial, PG+CAP is safe and possibly more effective in achieving full improvement of chronic contaminated wounds when compared to MediHoney.

Nurses perceive leg ulcer patients as ‘under‐served’ with regard to problems patients experience in daily life. An overview of patient problems is a first and essential step in the development of comprehensive nursing care. Aims and objectives. To gather information about the impact of leg ulcers on patient's daily life as described in quantitative and qualitative studies. Design. Systematic literature review. Methods. Medline and Cinahl databases were searched for venous leg ulcer studies, up to 2002; this was followed by the ‘snowball method’. Studies were selected in accordance with preset criteria. Results. A total of 37 studies was included. All studies report that leg ulcers pose a threat to physical functioning. Furthermore, a negative impact on psychological functioning is reported and, to a lesser degree, on social functioning. Major limitations are pain and immobility, followed by sleep disturbance, lack of energy, limitations in work and leisure activities, worries and frustrations and a lack of self‐esteem. Patients have a significantly poorer quality of life compared with healthy people. Finally, patients report problems with regard to follow‐up treatment. Conclusions. Having a leg ulcer has a major impact on a patient's life. There are indications of under‐treatment of pain. Relevance to clinical practice. Keeping in mind that leg ulceration is notorious for its chronic character, the negative impact on patient's life implies that many patients suffer over longer periods of time.

The guidelines report several recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of these pathologies in different chapters, with details on health questions and population described in the related text. These guidelines do not include patients with venous pathologies unrelated to CVD of the lower limbs nor patients suffering from venous or arteriovenous malformations. These guidelines provide guidance for vascular and general surgeons, vascular physicians, interventional radiologists, phlebologists, dermatologists, and emergency medicine physicians. The guidelines promote high standards of care (based on evidence, whenever available), established by specialists in the field. We wish to clarify that these guidelines are intended to support clinical decision making and that the recommendations may not be appropriate in all circumstances.

,10.1111/bjd.19621,British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for the management of people with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma 2020*,British Journal of Dermatology,2020.0,"Plain language summary available online The overall objective of the guideline is to provide up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations for the management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). The document aims to The guideline is presented as a detailed review with highlighted recommendations for practical use in primary, secondary and tertiary care, in the clinic and in the appropriate skin cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings (see section 3.0). These may be either local skin MDTs (LSMDTs) or specialist skin cancer MDTs (SSMDTs), depending on the clinicopathological features of the SCC. Clinicians treating people with cSCC should be core members of the appropriate MDT or sanctioned by the MDT to treat the tumour.1 There is also an updated patient information leaflet available on the BAD website (https://www.skinhealthinfo.org.uk/a-z-conditions-treatments/). The guideline does not cover This set of guidelines has been developed using the BAD's recommended methodology;5 further information can be found in Appendix J (see Supporting Information) with reference to the AGREE II instrument (www.agreetrust.org)6 and GRADE (https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org). Recommendations were developed for implementation in the UK National Health Service (NHS). The guideline development group (GDG) consisted of seven consultant dermatologists (representing England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales), two consultant clinical oncologists (radiation oncologists), a consultant plastic surgeon, a consultant maxillofacial surgeon, a dermatopathologist, a general practitioner, a Macmillan dermatology clinical nurse specialist, two patient representatives and a technical team (consisting of an information scientist, a guideline research fellow and a project manager providing methodological and technical support). The GDG established several clinical questions pertinent to the scope of the guideline and a set of outcome measures of importance to patients, ranked according to the GRADE methodology7 (see section 2.1; and Appendix A; see Supporting Information). The GDG agreed to adopt the Royal College of Pathologists dataset for the histological reporting of cSCC.8 Along with Public Health England, this endorses the Union for International Cancer Control 8th edition (UICC8)9 (Tables 1 and 2), rather than the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition cancer staging manual, which covers only head and neck cSCC.10 The GDG agreed that risk is part of a spectrum and not dichotomous, and the evidence from the literature searches supported a division based on low-, high- and very high-risk status. As shown in Figure 1, this division was achieved by integrating clinical, pathological, tumour–nodes–metastasis (TNM) staging and margin criteria. A systematic literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases was conducted by the technical team to identify key articles on cSCC from 1 January 2007 to 30 January 2020; the search terms and strategies are detailed in Appendix K (see Supporting Information). Additional references relevant to the topic were also isolated from citations in the reviewed literature and the previous versions of the guidelines.11, 12 Data extraction, critical appraisal and data synthesis were performed by the technical team, who prepared the evidence summaries, lists of excluded studies and PRISMA diagram. Evidence from included studies was rated according to the GRADE system (high, moderate, low or very low quality). Recommendations are based on evidence drawn from systematic reviews of the literature pertaining to the clinical questions identified, following discussions with the entire GDG and factoring in all four factors that would affect their strength ratings according to the GRADE approach (i.e. balance between desirable and undesirable effects, quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, and resource allocation). All GDG members contributed towards drafting and/or reviewing the narratives and information in the guideline and supporting information documents. When there was insufficient evidence from the literature, informal consensus was reached based on the experience of the GDG. The summary of findings with forest plots (Appendix B), clinical evidence summary (Appendix C), tables Linking the Evidence To the Recommendations (LETR) (Appendix D), GRADE evidence profiles indicating the quality of evidence (Appendix E), summary of included studies (Appendix F), narrative findings for noncomparative studies (Appendix G), PRISMA flow diagram (Appendix H) and list of excluded studies (Appendix I) are detailed in the Supporting Information. The strength of recommendation is expressed by the wording and symbols shown in Table 3. The GDG established a number of clinical questions pertinent to the scope of the guideline (for a full review protocol see Appendix A in the Supporting Information). The GDG also established a set of outcome measures of importance to patients for each clinical question, which were ranked according to the GRADE methodology7 by the patient representatives. This uses a nine-point scale, with outcomes ranked 9 being those the patient representatives considered most important. Outcomes ranked 9, 8 or 7 are critical for decision-making; those ranked 6, 5 or 4 are important but not critical for decision-making; and those ranked 3, 2 or 1 are the least important for decision-making. Data on these outcome measures were extracted from the included studies (Appendixes B, C, E, F and G; see Supporting Information). Review question 1: treatment In people with 'higher-risk' primary cSCC, how clinically effective are surgical (standard and Mohs) and nonsurgical treatments (radiotherapy and electrochemotherapy) compared with each other? Review question 2: treatment In people with low-risk primary cSCC how clinically effective are surgical (standard excision, Mohs, curettage and cautery, cryosurgery and carbon dioxide laser) and nonsurgical treatments (topical therapies, photodynamic therapy or radiotherapy) compared with each other or with no treatment (observation)? (Radiotherapy includes brachytherapy where appropriate.) Review question 3: surgical margin In people with cSCC who undergo standard surgical excision, what surgical margin and surgical plane should be used? Review question 4: involved margins In people with cSCC who undergo excision of the primary tumour and where histological analysis shows either one or more involved or clear-but-close margins (< 1 mm), what is the appropriate subsequent management? Review question 5: adjuvant radiotherapy In people with primary cSCC following surgical excision with clear histological margins, what is the role of adjuvant radiotherapy in reducing the risk of local recurrence?

Periodontitis is defined by pathologic loss of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. The disease involves complex dynamic interactions among active herpesviruses, specific bacterial pathogens and destructive immune responses. Periodontal diagnostics is currently based on clinical rather than etiologic criteria, and provides limited therapeutic guidance. Periodontal causative treatment consists of scaling, antiseptic rinses and occasionally systemic antibiotics, and surgical intervention has been de‐emphasized, except perhaps for the most advanced types of periodontitis. Plastic surgical therapy includes soft‐tissue grafting to cover exposed root surfaces and bone grafting to provide support for implants. Dental implants are used to replace severely diseased or missing teeth, but implant overuse is of concern. The utility of laser treatment for periodontitis remains unresolved. Host modulation and risk‐factor modification therapies may benefit select patient groups. Patient self‐care is a critical part of periodontal health care, and twice‐weekly oral rinsing with 0.10‐0.25% sodium hypochlorite constitutes a valuable adjunct to conventional anti‐plaque and anti‐gingivitis treatments. A link between periodontal herpesviruses and systemic diseases is a strong biological plausibility. In summary, research during the past 25 years has significantly changed our concepts of periodontitis pathobiology and has produced more‐effective and less‐costly therapeutic options.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,none,2.0

Most methodologies to assess itching suffer from being unidimensional, for example only measuring intensity without impact on quality of life, or only measuring scratching activity. None has actually been demonstrated to be able to detect change over time, which is essential to using them as an outcome measure of response to an intervention. The 5‐D itch scale was developed as a brief but multidimensional questionnaire designed to be useful as an outcome measure in clinical trials. The five dimensions are degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution. Objectives To study the 5‐D with respect to validity, reliability and response to change. Methods The 5‐D was administered to 234 individuals with chronic pruritus due to liver disease (n = 63), kidney disease (n = 36), dermatological disorders (n = 56), HIV/AIDS (n = 28) and burn injuries (n = 51). The 5‐D was administered at baseline and after a 6‐week follow‐up period. A subset of 50 untreated patients was retested after 3 days to assess test–retest reliability. Results The 5‐D score correlated strongly with a visual analogue score: r = 0·727 at baseline (P < 0·0001), r = 0·868 at the 3‐day repeat (P < 0·0001), and r = 0·892 at the 6‐week follow‐up (P < 0·0001). There was no change in mean 5‐D score between day 1 and day 3 in untreated individuals (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0·96, P < 0·0001). The 5‐D did, however, detect significant changes in pruritus over the 6‐week follow‐up period (P < 0·0001). Subanalysis of the different patient groups revealed similar response patterns and scores, with the exception of lower total scores for the burn victims due to lower scores on the distribution domain because they itched only at the site of their burn. Conclusions The 5‐D, therefore, is a reliable, multidimensional measure of itching that has been validated in patients with chronic pruritus to able to detect changes over time. The 5‐D should be useful as an outcome measure in clinical trials.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,2,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,9.0

Conventional dressings passively aid healing by maintaining moisture at wound sites. Recent developments have focused on drug and cell delivery to drive a healing process, but these methods are often complicated by drug side effects, sophisticated fabrication, and high cost. Here, we present novel active adhesive dressings consisting of thermoresponsive tough adhesive hydrogels that combine high stretchability, toughness, tissue adhesion, and antimicrobial function. They adhere strongly to the skin and actively contract wounds, in response to exposure to the skin temperature. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate their efficacy in accelerating and supporting skin wound healing.

Life-threatening pathological conditions arise when ECM remodeling becomes excessive or uncontrolled. In this Perspective, we focus on how ECM remodeling contributes to fibrotic diseases and cancer, which both present challenging obstacles with respect to clinical treatment, to illustrate the importance and complexity of cell-ECM interactions in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Fibrotic diseases, which include pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, liver cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease, account for over 45% of deaths in the developed world. ECM remodeling is also crucial for tumor malignancy and metastatic progression, which ultimately cause over 90% of deaths from cancer. Here, we discuss current methodologies and models for understanding and quantifying the impact of environmental cues provided by the ECM on disease progression, and how improving our understanding of ECM remodeling in these pathological conditions is crucial for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.

Wound infections were diagnosed by blinded investigators using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Baseline patient characteristics, anesthetic treatment, and potential confounding factors were recorded.InterventionsPatients were randomly assigned to either 30% or 80% fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) intraoperatively and for 6 hours after surgery. Anesthetic treatment and antibiotic administration were standardized.Main Outcome MeasuresAny surgical site infection (SSI); secondary outcomes included return of bowel function and ability to tolerate solid food, ambulation, suture removal, and duration of hospitalization.ResultsA total of 143 patients received 30% perioperative oxygen and 148 received 80% perioperative oxygen. Surgical site infection occurred in 35 patients (24.4%) administered 30% FIO2 and in 22 patients (14.9%) administered 80% FIO2 (P=.04). The risk of SSI was 39% lower in the 80% FIO2 group (relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.98) vs the 30% FIO2 group. After adjustment for important covariates, the RR of infection in patients administered supplemental oxygen was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.22-0.95; P = .04).

Health outcomes included clinical endpoints (objective assessments of function, disease severity, and mortality; subjective health assessments) and surrogate endpoints (biological markers that substitute for clinical endpoints, such as blood pressure). Biological mediators included cardiovascular reactivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Greater marital quality was related to better health, with mean effect sizes from r = .07 to .21, including lower risk of mortality (r = .11) and lower cardiovascular reactivity during marital conflict (r = -.13), but not daily cortisol slopes or cortisol reactivity during conflict. The small effect sizes were similar in magnitude to previously found associations between health behaviors (e.g., diet) and health outcomes. Effect sizes for a small subset of clinical outcomes were susceptible to publication bias. In some studies, effect sizes remained significant after accounting for confounds such as age and socioeconomic status. Studies with a higher proportion of women in the sample demonstrated larger effect sizes, but we found little evidence for gender differences in studies that explicitly tested gender moderation, with the exception of surrogate endpoint studies. Our conclusions are limited by small numbers of studies for specific health outcomes, unexplained heterogeneity, and designs that limit causal inferences.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a small intestine submucosal patch to augment the repair of chronic two-tendon rotator cuff tears in humans.Thirty shoulders with a chronic two-tendon rotator cuff tear that was completely repairable with open surgery were randomized to be treated with either augmentation with porcine small intestine mucosa or no augmentation. All patients completed a PENN shoulder-score questionnaire preoperatively and at the time of the latest follow-up (at an average of fourteen months). Magnetic resonance imaging showed that nine shoulders had a large tear and twenty-one had a massive tear. All patients underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan with intra-articular gadolinium one year after the repair to assess the status of the rotator cuff.The rotator cuff healed in four of the fifteen shoulders in the augmentation group compared with nine of the fifteen in the control group (p = 0.11). The median postoperative PENN total score was 83 points in the augmentation group compared with 91 points in the control group (p = 0.07). Healing of the defects in both groups demonstrated a strong correlation with the patients' clinical scores. The median postoperative PENN total score was 96 points in the group with a healed repair and 81 points in the group with a failed repair (p = 0.007).

The prevalence of malnutrition is increasing in this population and is associated with a decline in: functional status, impaired muscle function, decreased bone mass, immune dysfunction, anemia, reduced cognitive function, poor wound healing, delayed recovery from surgery, higher hospital readmission rates, and mortality. Older people often have reduced appetite and energy expenditure, which, coupled with a decline in biological and physiological functions such as reduced lean body mass, changes in cytokine and hormonal level, and changes in fluid electrolyte regulation, delay gastric emptying and diminish senses of smell and taste. In addition pathologic changes of aging such as chronic diseases and psychological illness all play a role in the complex etiology of malnutrition in older people. Nutritional assessment is important to identify and treat patients at risk, the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool being commonly used in clinical practice. Management requires a holistic approach, and underlying causes such as chronic illness, depression, medication and social isolation must be treated. Patients with physical or cognitive impairment require special care and attention.

Here we describe a novel design and a proof-of-concept validation of a mobile skin bioprinting system that provides rapid on-site management of extensive wounds. Integrated imaging technology facilitated the precise delivery of either autologous or allogeneic dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes directly into an injured area, replicating the layered skin structure. Excisional wounds bioprinted with layered autologous dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes in a hydrogel carrier showed rapid wound closure, reduced contraction and accelerated re-epithelialization.

We explore seven types of process models: (a) anger as a dangerous emotion, (b) active listening, (c) negative affect reciprocity, (d) negative start-up by wife, (e) de-escalation, (f) positive affect models, and (g) physiological soothing of male. Support was not found for models of anger as a dangerous emotion, active listening, or negative affect reciprocity. Support was found for models of husband's rejecting his wife's influence, negative start-up by wife, a lack of de-escalation of low intensity negative wife affect by husband, or a lack of de-escalation of high intensity husband negative affect by wife, and a lack of physiological soothing of male, all predicting divorce. Support was found for a contingent positive affect model and for balance models (i.e., ratio models) of positive-to-negative affect predicting satisfaction among stable couples. Divorce and stability were predicted with 83% accuracy and satisfaction with 80% accuracy. Key Words: divorce, gender, interaction, newlyweds, physiology. Recently some of our best scholars (e.g., Jacobson & Addis, 1993) have contended that marital therapy has relapse rates so high that entire enterprise may be in a state of crisis. Consistent with these conclusions, recent Consumer Reports study of psychotherapy (Seligman, 1995) also reported that marital therapy received lowest marks from psychotherapy consumers. Marital therapy may be at an impasse because it is not based on a process model derived from prospective longitudinal studies of what real couples do that predicts if their marriages will wind up happy and stable, unhappy and stable, or end in divorce. Differential longitudinal prediction of marital satisfaction and stability may be an essential step that has been omitted in designing marital therapy. Building a process model of marriage using this prediction approach could turn out to be superior to building an intervention by imagining what target populations in trouble may need or by imagining it according to some theoretical position. What has happened in field of marital therapy is that a psychotherapy of marriage has been constructed by extending methods of psychotherapy to design of marital interventions, instead of building a marital therapy from way people normally go about process of staying happily married. However, we should point out that this is an assumption. This could be called the single theory assumption, which claims that functioning, dysfunctioning, and repair of marital relationships can be explained using one theory. Alternatively, it might be case that any process, such as active listening, might be a great intervention, even if people don't naturally do it. Thus, to use an analogy, it might be case that more than one set of orthopedic knowledge is necessary in marriage, one about normally developing of marriage and another about how to repair broken bones in therapy. We do not think that this will be case. We attempt to build such a process model of marriage. What processes ought to be included for investigation in building a process model? It may be inadequate to simply describe what is dysfunctional when a marriage is ailing. It may be necessary to describe what is functional when a marriage is working well. This may not be redundant information.

It addresses question of whether all negative affects are equally corrosive in marriages. …",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,3.0

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes (Exo) have been proven to be appropriate candidates for diabetic wound healing through the anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we investigated whether melatonin (MT)-pretreated MSCs-derived exosomes (MT-Exo) could exert superior effects on diabetic wound healing, and we attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Methods For the evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effect of MT-Exo, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. For in vitro research, we detected the secreted levels of inflammation-related factors, such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-10 via ELISA and the relative gene expression of the IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10, Arg-1 and iNOS via qRT-PCR and investigated the expression of PTEN, AKT and p-AKT by Western blotting. For in vivo study, we established air pouch model and streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic wound model, and evaluated the effect of MT-Exo by flow cytometry, optical imaging, H&amp;E staining, Masson trichrome staining, immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR (α-SMA, collagen I and III). Results MT-Exo significantly suppressed the pro-inflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α and reduced the relative gene expression of IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS, while promoting the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 along with increasing the relative expression of IL-10 and Arg-1, compared with that of the PBS, LPS and the Exo groups in vitro. This effect was mediated by the increased ratio of M2 polarization to M1 polarization through upregulating the expression of PTEN and inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT. Similarly, MT-Exo significantly promoted the healing of diabetic wounds by inhibiting inflammation, thereby further facilitating angiogenesis and collagen synthesis in vivo. Conclusions MT-Exo could promote diabetic wound healing by suppressing the inflammatory response, which was achieved by increasing the ratio of M2 polarization to M1 polarization through activating the PTEN/AKT signalling pathway, and the pretreatment of MT was proved to be a promising method for treating diabetic wound healing.

Normally, grief does not need clinical intervention. However, sometimes acute grief can gain a foothold and become a chronic debilitating condition called complicated grief. Moreover, the stress caused by bereavement, like other stressors, can increase the likelihood of onset or worsening of other physical or mental disorders. Hence, some bereaved people need to be diagnosed and treated. A clinician evaluating a bereaved person is at risk for both over-and under-diagnosis, either pathologizing a normal condition or neglecting to treat an impairing disorder. The authors of DSM IV focused primarily on the problem of over-diagnosis, and omitted complicated grief because of insufficient evidence. We revisit bereavement considerations in light of new research findings.

The incidence of ulceration is rising as a result of the ageing population and increased risk factors for atherosclerotic occlusion such as smoking, obesity and diabetes. Ulcers can be defined as wounds with a 'full thickness depth' and a 'slow healing tendency'. In general, the slow healing tendency is not simply explained by depth and size, but caused by an underlying pathogenetic factor that needs to be removed to induce healing. The main causes are venous valve insufficiency, lower extremity arterial disease and diabetes. Less frequent conditions are infection, vasculitis, skin malignancies and ulcerating skin diseases such as pyoderma gangrenosum. But even rarer conditions exist, such as the recently discovered combination of vasculitis and hypercoagulability.

,10.3310/hta5220,The measurement and monitoring of surgical adverse events,Health Technology Assessment,2001.0,"Surgical adverse events contribute significantly to postoperative morbidity, yet the measurement and monitoring of events is often imprecise and of uncertain validity. Given the trend of decreasing length of hospital stay and the increase in use of innovative surgical techniques--particularly minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures--accurate measurement and monitoring of adverse events is crucial.The aim of this methodological review was to identify a selection of common and potentially avoidable surgical adverse events and to assess whether they could be reliably and validly measured, to review methods for monitoring their occurrence and to identify examples of effective monitoring systems for selected events. This review is a comprehensive attempt to examine the quality of the definition, measurement, reporting and monitoring of selected events that are known to cause significant postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS - SELECTION OF SURGICAL ADVERSE EVENTS: Four adverse events were selected on the basis of their frequency of occurrence and likelihood of evidence of measurement and monitoring: (1) surgical wound infection; (2) anastomotic leak; (3) deep vein thrombosis (DVT); (4) surgical mortality. Surgical wound infection and DVT are common events that cause significant postoperative morbidity. Anastomotic leak is a less common event, but risk of fatality is associated with delay in recognition, detection and investigation. Surgical mortality was selected because of the effort known to have been invested in developing systems for monitoring surgical death, both in the UK and internationally. Systems for monitoring surgical wound infection were also included in the review. METHODS - LITERATURE SEARCH: Thirty separate, systematic literature searches of core health and biomedical bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, HealthSTAR and the Cochrane Library) were conducted. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed to locate additional articles. A matrix was developed whereby different literature and study designs were reviewed for each of the surgical adverse events. Each article eligible for inclusion was independently reviewed by two assessors. METHODS - CRITICAL APPRAISAL: Studies were appraised according to predetermined assessment criteria. Definitions and grading scales were assessed for: content, criterion and construct validity; repeatability; reproducibility; and practicality (surgical wound infection and anastomotic leak). Monitoring systems for surgical wound infection and surgical mortality were assessed on the following criteria: (1) coverage of the system; (2) whether or not denominator data were collected; (3) whether standard and agreed definitions were used; (4) inclusion of risk adjustment; (5) issues related to data collection; (6) postdischarge surveillance; (7) output in terms of feedback and wider dissemination. RESULTS - SURGICAL WOUND INFECTION: A total of 41 different definitions and 13 grading scales of surgical wound infection were identified from 82 studies. Definitions of surgical wound infection varied from presence of pus to complex definitions such as those proposed by the Centres for Disease Control in the USA. A small body of literature has been published on the content, criterion and construct validity of different definitions, and comparisons have been made against wound assessment scales and multidimensional indices. There are examples of comprehensive hospital-based monitoring systems of surgical wound infection, mainly under the auspices of nosocomial surveillance. To date, however, there is little evidence of systematic measurement and monitoring of surgical wound infection after hospital discharge. RESULTS - ANASTOMOTIC LEAK: Over 40 definitions of anastomotic leak were extracted from 107 studies of upper gastrointestinal, hepatopancreaticobiliary and lower gastrointestinal surgery. No formal evaluations were found that assessed the validity or reliability of definitions or severity scales of anastomotic leak. One definition was proposed during a national consensus workshop, but no evidence of its use was found in the surgical literature. The lack of a single definition or gold standard hampers comparison of postoperative anastomotic leak rates between studies and institutions. RESULTS - DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS: Although a critical review of the DVT literature could not be completed within the realms of this review, it was evident that a number of new techniques for the detection and diagnosis of DVT have emerged in the last 20 years. The group recommends a separate review be undertaken of the different diagnostic tests to detect DVT. RESULTS - SURGICAL MORTALITY MONITORING SYSTEMS: The definition of surgical mortality is relatively consistent between monitoring systems, but duration of follow-up of death postdischarge varies considerably. The majority of systems report in-hospital mortality rates; only some have the potential to link deaths to national death registers. Risk assessment is an important factor and there should be a distinction between recording pre-intervention factors and postoperative complications. A variety of risk scoring systems was identified in the review. Factors associated with accurate and complete data collection include the employment of local, dedicated personnel, simple and structured prompts to ensure that clinical input is complete, and accurate and automated data capture and transfer.The use of standardised, valid and reliable definitions is fundamental to the accurate measurement and monitoring of surgical adverse events. This review found inconsistency in the quality of reporting of postoperative adverse events, limiting accurate comparison of rates over time and between institutions. The duration of follow-up for individual events will vary according to their natural history and epidemiology. Although risk-adjusted aggregated rates can act as screening or warning systems for adverse events, attribution of whether events are avoidable or preventable will invariably require further investigation at the level of the individual, unit or department. CONCLUSIONS - RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH: (1) A single, standard definition of surgical wound infection is needed so that comparisons over time and between departments and institutions are valid, accurate and useful. Surgeons and other healthcare professionals should consider adopting the 1992 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition for superficial incisional, deep incisional and organ/space surgical site infection for hospital monitoring programmes and surgical audits. There is a need for further methodological research into the performance of the CDC definition in the UK setting. (2) There is a need to formally assess the reliability of self-diagnosis of surgical wound infection by patients. (3) There is a need to assess formally the reliability of case ascertainment by infection control staff. (4) Work is needed to create and agree a standard,",OpenAlex,1,0,27,0,0,3,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,wound_assessment,56.5

Oxidative/Nitrosative stress is the result of an disequilibrium in oxidant/antioxidant which reveals from continuous increase of Reactive Oxygen and Reactive Nitrogen Species production. The aim of this review is to emphasize with current information the importance of antioxidants which play the role in cellular responce against oxidative/nitrosative stress, which would be helpful in enhancing the knowledge of any biochemist, pathophysiologist, or medical personnel regarding this important issue. Products of lipid peroxidation have commonly been used as biomarkers of oxidative/nitrosative stress damage. Lipid peroxidation generates a variety of relatively stable decomposition end products, mainly α, β-unsaturated reactive aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, 2-propenal (acrolein) and isoprostanes, which can be measured in plasma and urine as an indirect index of oxidative/nitrosative stress. Antioxidants are exogenous or endogenous molecules that mitigate any form of oxidative/nitrosative stress or its consequences. They may act from directly scavenging free radicals to increasing antioxidative defences. Antioxidant deficiencies can develop as a result of decreased antioxidant intake, synthesis of endogenous enzymes or increased antioxidant utilization.

Plasma comprises a multitude of active components such as charged particles, electric current, UV radiation, and reactive gas species which can act synergistically. Anti-itch, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, tissue-stimulating, blood flow-enhancing, and proapoptotic effects were demonstrated in in vivo and in vitro experiments, and until now, no resistance of pathogens against plasma treatment was observed. The combination of the different active agents and their broad range of positive effects on various diseases, especially easily accessible skin diseases, renders plasma quite attractive for applications in medicine. For medical applications, two different types of cold plasma appear suitable: indirect (plasma jet) and direct (dielectric barrier discharge-DBD) plasma sources.

Individual preferences, drawn from experience and study, determine whether treatment is operative or nonoperative.Our goal was to review the literature to try to determine what management method was the most popular and effective. We wanted to ascertain the best results in terms of complication rates and patient outcomes.Retrospective review of retrospectively and prospectively collected data.We analyzed 125 articles in peer-reviewed journals for year of publication, patient numbers, sex, management method, follow-up complications, and patient satisfaction. Each article was graded using a validated methods score. Methods, patient satisfaction, and complication rates were correlated with the year each article was published.Skin-healing complications were lowest in conservatively managed patients (3 of 578, 0.5%) and highest in open repair and immobilized patients (543 of 3718, 14.6%). General complication rates were lowest in open repair and early-mobilization groups (16 of 238, 6.7%) and highest in percutaneous and early-mobilization groups (19 of 122, 15.6%).

This process is characterized by the recruitment and differentiation of osteoblastic and osteoclastic cell populations, whose cellular activities are coordinated and regulated by an elaborate system of growth factors and cytokines. One of the crucial biological factors responsible for reparative osseous activity is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The potent stimulatory effects of PDGF as a chemoattractant and mitogen for mesenchymal cells (including osteogenic cells), along with its ability to promote angiogenesis, have been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models predicting maxillofacial, spine and appendicular skeletal, and soft-tissue applications. The biological profile of PDGF, including its ability to recruit osteoprogenitor cells, makes it particularly suited to address the skeletal defects that are seen with comorbid conditions such as osteoporosis, diabetes, and the effects of smoking. The clinical success and safety that have been demonstrated with use of recombinant human PDGF (rhPDGF) in the repair of periodontal defects have led to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of rhPDGF for this indication.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the magnitude and duration of postoperative analgesia from a single dose of bupivacaine extended-release injection with placebo administered intraoperatively in patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy. DESIGN: This evaluation was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 3 study. SETTINGS: Data were obtained from 13 centers in the Republic of Georgia, Poland, and Serbia. PATIENTS: Included in this study were patients aged 18 to 86 years undergoing excisional hemorrhoidectomy. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received either a single dose of bupivacaine extended-release 300 mg or placebo administered intraoperatively via wound infiltration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The cumulative pain score was assessed by measurement of the area under the curve of pain intensity through 72 hours after study drug administration. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine patients were randomly assigned and treated; 186 completed the study. Pain intensity scores were significantly lower in the bupivacaine extended-release group in comparison with the group receiving placebo (141.8 vs 202.5, P < .0001). More patients in the bupivacaine extended-release group remained opioid free from 12 hours (59%) to 72 hours (28%) after surgery compared with patients receiving placebo (14% and 10%; P < .0008 through 72 h). The mean total amount of opioids consumed through 72 hours was 22.3 mg and 29.1 mg in the bupivacaine extended-release and placebo groups (P ≤ .0006). The median time to first opioid use was 14.3 hours in the bupivacaine extended-release group vs 1.2 hours in the placebo group (P < .0001). A greater proportion of patients in the bupivacaine extended-release group were satisfied with their postsurgical analgesia (95% vs 73%, P = .0007) than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Bupivacaine extended-release demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain through 72 hours, decreased opioid requirements, delayed time to first opioid use, and improved patient satisfaction compared with placebo after hemorrhoidectomy.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,3.0

I see the ones who waited too long and the ones who arrived too late because they live in an underserved community and didn't have access to testing or treatment. When I close my eyes at night, I recall a patient, full of catheters and tubes and attached to machines, who breathlessly whispers words I cannot decipher as his life recedes. Again, I watch the monitor document the last moments of life as he lay there alone. I hear the pained conversations informing family members that they cannot visit because the risk of spreading the virus is too great; exceptions are made only if we are able to predict when death is near—but now it is often and unpredictably near. And I wonder, ""Was I a good nurse today? What kind of person have I become?"" A year ago, I was one sort of nurse—attentive, compassionate, diligent, quick with a smile and a hug. Being a good nurse aligned with being a good human being.Sleep proves elusive, and I feel a fracture between who I want to be and who I sense I am becoming. It hurts. How did this happen? Blame and shame arise for things done or left undone, and for harms witnessed but not prevented, both inside and outside the hospital. In the intensive care unit and in the streets, I see that we sink or swim together. What is my contribution? Am I lifting others up or dragging them down? I don't know anymore and wonder where I lost my moral compass.This nurse's experiences have been exacerbated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but they are not entirely unfamiliar. Nurses have for millennia confronted and borne witness to suffering, especially moral suffering. Moral suffering is the ""anguish experienced in response to moral harms, wrongs or failures and unrelieved moral stress,""2 and it is triggered by witnessing, participating in, or directly precipitating situations that produce negative moral outcomes and imperil integrity and well-being.The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated long-standing ethical issues within our health care system and its enactment of the structural inequalities of society. The frequency at which ethical dilemmas now occur does not allow for nimble adjustments to systems and often intensifies the distress clinicians experience. Clinicians face resource limitations and the uncertainty of evolving and often conflicting guidance about what protection is needed in order to deliver safe care to patients. They confront hard decisions about who will receive which potentially life-saving treatment— decisions made on the basis of explicit criteria and processes that reveal unconscious biases about vulnerable patients. Others struggle with the dissonance of departing from evidence-based standards of care; they flood patients with benzodiazepines, immobilize them, keep their families away, and through cold glass bear witness to the delirium that ensues. The ethical question of how to allocate nursing staff has turned medical care inside out. Instead of focusing on how to maximize the benefit to each patient, care teams are now considering how the fewest people can spend the least time with a critically ill human being.Who has access to personal protective equipment? Who is put in harm's way? Who gets to work from home? Who is considered ""essential"" and why? These moral questions are for a society in which injustice and violence disproportionately afflict workers according to race and sex, distress that may be amplified for those whose history in the United States is tied to the structural inequalities that put them and their families at greater risk of infection and death. These systemic and societal disruptions can accumulate at a pace that neither frontline nurses nor their leaders can effectively respond to, and they can lead to overwhelming feelings of betrayal and moral compromise. The lasting consequences of the pandemic on medical professionals, combined with an already overwhelmed health care system and continuing injustice and hate crimes in society, require us to identify and address the moral suffering of all health care workers.In its many forms, moral suffering can be viewed along a continuum of responses to moral adversity that imperil integrity.2 The intensity, duration, and consequences vary depending on the sources of adversity and the roles and unique characteristics of the persons involved and the organizations where they work. Moral alarm can initially occur as a quivering of awareness in our bodies when we perceive that something we value is being threatened; this perception then activates a neutral state of readiness to appraise and respond to the source of the adversity.2 This threat appraisal may lead an individual to garner necessary resources, determine a course of action, and release or resolve the moral stress. When the intensity of moral stress exceeds the person's capacity to remain grounded and whole, moral distress or moral injury can ensue.Moral distress, initially described in the nursing literature, is the inability to translate moral choices into actions because of internal or external constraints, producing anguish characterized by feelings of guilt, shame, anger, or powerlessness.3 It is an embodied experience: a person in distress perceives physical sensations or symptoms before becoming cognitively aware of it.4–6 The distress occurs in response to various sources of moral adversity that ""produce morally objectionable, troublesome, or unfortunate circumstances that can imperil integrity and well-being (individually or collectively).""2(p35) Critical care nurses practicing during the COVID-19 pandemic are confronting complex ethical challenges, and their actions are constrained by circumstances beyond their control. Nurses may perceive their choices—or their lack thereof—as moral failings, which can cause feelings of anger, shame, or regret.7 They may view their distress as reflecting how their moral conscientiousness is attuned to the moral dimensions of their role, and consider moral trade-offs as an inevitable aspect of caring for high-acuity patients under conditions of medical uncertainty and diverse value systems.2 A physician in a neonatal intensive care unit wrote, ""I think if one does not experience moral distress occasionally in our environment they should not be working with our patients.""8(pF443) This",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,3.5

A pediatric malnutrition definitions workgroup reviewed existing pediatric age group English‐language literature from 1955 to 2011, for relevant references related to 5 domains of the definition of malnutrition that were a priori identified: anthropometric parameters, growth, chronicity of malnutrition, etiology and pathogenesis, and developmental/ functional outcomes. Based on available evidence and an iterative process to arrive at multidisciplinary consensus in the group, these domains were included in the overall construct of a new definition. Pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) is defined as an imbalance between nutrient requirements and intake that results in cumulative deficits of energy, protein, or micronutrients that may negatively affect growth, development, and other relevant outcomes. A summary of the literature is presented and a new classification scheme is proposed that incorporates chronicity, etiology, mechanisms of nutrient imbalance, severity of malnutrition, and its impact on outcomes. Based on its etiology, malnutrition is either illness related (secondary to 1 or more diseases/injury) or non–illness related , (caused by environmental/behavioral factors), or both. Future research must focus on the relationship between inflammation and illness‐related malnutrition.

Here we identify major transcriptional networks deregulated in DFUs that result in decreased neutrophils and macrophages recruitment and overall poorly controlled inflammatory response. Transcription factors FOXM1 and STAT3 , which function to activate and promote survival of immune cells, are inhibited in DFUs. Moreover, inhibition of FOXM1 in diabetic mouse models (STZ-induced and db/db) results in delayed wound healing and decreased neutrophil and macrophage recruitment in diabetic wounds in vivo.

Using a combination of proliferation kinetics experiments and molecular profiling, we identify the gene signatures associated with proliferation, differentiation and migration in different regions surrounding the wound. Functional experiments show that SC proliferation, migration and differentiation can be uncoupled during wound healing. Lineage tracing and quantitative clonal analysis reveal that, following wounding, progenitors divide more rapidly, but conserve their homoeostatic mode of division, leading to their rapid depletion, whereas SCs become active, giving rise to new progenitors that expand and repair the wound.

,10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01864.x,Current Status Of Antiangiogenic Factors,British Journal of Haematology,2000.0,"Angiogenesis is a multistep process in which new blood vessels grow from existing vessels. It occurs as part of the normal menstrual cycle in the ovary and endometrium and it occurs in pathophysiological conditions such as wound healing, proliferative retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, paediatric haemangiomas and within tumours. It has been proposed that a tumour is growth limited to 1–2 mm2 by the diffusion of nutrients unless it recruits additional blood vessels and, hence, an 'angiogenic switch' is a critical step in tumorigenesis ( 44). The sequential steps required for angiogenesis are extracellular matrix remodelling, endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and capillary differentiation and anastomosis ( 110). This process can be triggered by the secretion of angiogenic factors, either directly by the tumour cells or by accessory cells in the tumour stroma (Fig 1). Maturation and stabilization of these new vessels occurs through the recruitment of pericytes and involves platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietins ( 62; 34). Role of tumour cells and tumour-associated macrophages in angiogenesis. A large number of angiogenic factors have been identified (Table I) by looking for the development of new vessels in a variety of in vivo assays: chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM) ( 43), rabbit corneal implant assay ( 52), hamster cheek pouch assay and rodent subcutaneous sponge model ( 3). Their effects on the different component steps of angiogenesis have then been dissected out using a variety of in vitro models: thymidine uptake or cell counts to study endothelial cell proliferation, migration in the Boyden chamber or in wound healing models, and tube formation in three-dimensional substrates such as collagen or matrigel. More recently, gene knockout data and xenograft studies have expanded the understanding of the role of individual cytokines. Further complexity exists with one endothelial cell receptor, tyrosine kinase, that contains immunoglobulin-like loops and EGF homology domains (Tie-2), mediating either pro- or antiangiogenic activity depending on the ligand binding, angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1) ( 35; 128) or angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) ( 84). Ang-1 activates the Tie-2 receptor and is associated with developing blood vessels, its absence leading to defects in vessel remodelling. Ang-2 antagonizes the actions of Ang-1 and plays a role in the destabilization of existing vessels dependent on local concentrations of angiogenic cytokines. The phenomenon of concomitant tumour resistance, the ability of a large primary tumour to hold smaller tumours in check, led to the discovery of thrombospondin ( 54), an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Many more endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis have now been identified, many of which are fragments of larger proteins ( 113), themselves devoid of any antiangiogenic activity (Table II). These include angiostatin, which is a cleavage product of plasminogen ( 100), and endostatin, a cleavage product of type XVIII collagen ( 99). Most recently described is vasostatin ( 102). It has become apparent that angiogenesis is the result of a complex dynamic balance of positive and negative regulators, and over the time-course of any tumour's development the relative importance of several different angiogenic factors and inhibitors will fluctuate. Hypoxia occurs both early in tumour growth and throughout expansion and it can regulate the expression of a diverse group of genes: erythropoietin, VEGF, glycolytic pathway enzymes, transferrin, haem oxygenase and inducible nitric oxide ( 57). Regulation is controlled by the hypoxic stabilization of a transcriptional complex, termed hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), binding to a consensus region of the genes, termed the hypoxia response element (HRE) ( 118). HIF-1 consists of a heterodimer of two proteins, HIF-1α and HIF-1β, and is targeted for rapid proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions ( 114). Alternative dimerization partners for HIF-1β, structurally homologous to HIF-1α, have been identified: endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS-1) ( 131), recently termed HIF-2α ( 142) and HIF-3α ( 56). HIF-2α can transactivate a similar group of genes as HIF-1α ( 144). Inhibition of this pathway has a major effect in xenograft studies, reducing both tumour size and vessel density ( 87). Studies of HIF-1α knock-outs and deficient embryonic stem cells have affirmed its essential role in solid tumour vascular formation and embryonic vascularization ( 24; 112). Activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes provides a mechanism by which tumours may switch on and sustain angiogenesis, by gain and loss of function, by increasing angiogenic factors and reducing endogenous inhibitors respectively. Inhibition of overexpressed proto-oncogenes or mutant oncogenes could thus provide a therapeutic target ( 73). The role of tumour-suppressor genes in angiogenesis was first established for p53. Wild-type p53 is a positive regulator of thrombospondin expression, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis; inactivation of p53 by mutation or deletional events results in loss of thrombospondin expression ( 33). Recently, loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour-suppressor gene has been shown to interfere with the proteasomal degradation of HIFs, leading to high normoxic expression ( 88). This provides a mechanism for the previously reported up-regulation of VEGF within tumours with VHL mutations ( 121). Expression of a variety of oncogenes has been reported to be associated with up-regulation of angiogenic factors. Mutant ras is associated with up-regulated VEGF ( 104). In addition to VEGF, H-ras has been shown to stimulate angiogenesis by up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and down-regulation of tissue inhibitor of MMP ( 5). The v-src oncogene has also been found to increase expression of VEGF and HIF-1α under both normoxia and hypoxia ( 68). Understanding the sequential processes involved has facilitated both the development of targeting strategies for new agents and the screening of potential therapeutic agents. Recently, there have been a number of very exciting publications of inhibition of angiogenesis in a range of animal models by both gene therapy ( 53; 82) and the new agents endostatin and angiostatin ( 13), providing further proof of the principle that tumours are dependent on angiogenesis. The majority of antiangiogenic agents are still at an early stage of development in phase I, II or III clinical trials.

Moreover, regression of liver fibrosis in these model systems can be stimulated with drugs that target the activities of fibrogenic hepatic stellate cells. These findings are exciting as they suggest that established fibrosis is susceptible to regression and possibly even reversion. Alongside these experimental studies is a growing body of clinical data that suggest regression of fibrosis may also occur in liver disease patients for whom an effective treatment is available for their underlying liver injury.

While there is no doubt that protein–energy undernutrition has serious implications for health, recovery from illness or surgery and hospital costs, lack of nationally or internationally accepted cut-off points and guidelines for most nutrition-related variables make nutritional assessment difficult and proper comparisons between studies impossible. In reviewing published work in which the prevalence of undernutrition has been assessed, it can be seen that each study defined undernutrition, or nutritional risk, using different methodology. This present review aims to highlight the problems which arise when deciphering these studies, and the resulting difficulty in determining the true prevalence of undernutrition and nutritional risk, amongst both general and specific groups of hospital in-patients. It is widely agreed that routine hospital practices can further adversely affect the nutritional status of sick patients in hospital. How this occurs, and the potential effects of impaired nutritional status on clinical outcome are examined. The methods currently available to assess nutritional status are evaluated in the knowledge that such assessments are difficult in clinical practice. The review concludes by proposing that if we want the medical and nursing professions to consider the nutritional status of hospital patients seriously, definitions of undernutrition and nutritional risk, and cut-off values for the nutritional variables measured must be agreed to allow evidence-based practice. Outcome measures which allow clear comparisons between groups and treatments must be used in studies assessing the effects of nutritional interventions.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

Measurements: Selected vascular, neuropathic, environmental, health care, self care, nutritional, metabolic, lifestyle, and psychosocial risk factors were measured in all patients before surgery. Results: Statistically significant risk factors identified from analysis included insufficient mean below-knee and foot cutaneous circulation (odds ratio, 161; 95% Cl, 55.1 to 469); ankle-arm blood pressure index < 0.45 (odds ratio, 55.8; Cl, 14.9 to 209); absence of lower leg vibratory perception (odds ratio, 15.5; Cl, 8.3 to 28.7); low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subfraction 3 ≤ 0.7 µmol/L (odds ratio, 4.9; Cl, 2.9 to 8.3); and no previous outpatient diabetes education (odds ratio, 3.2; Cl, 1.6 to 6.6). A logistic regression analysis done to control for the potentially confounding effects of age; race; socioeconomic status; diabetes duration, type, and severity confirmed these findings and added a statistically significant interaction between foot transcutaneous oxygen tension and peripheral vascular disease history. Clinical interventions to alter these risk factors were identified, including aggressive treatment of infection, diabetes education, protective footwear, and preventive footcare. Conclusions: Multiple risk factors exist along the continuum of conditions and events leading to lower extremity amputation in diabetes. Modification of certain risk factors by patients and health professionals may reduce the risk for amputation and thus decrease the human and dollar costs that accompany limb loss in this prevalent chronic disease.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,infection,none,1.5

The oral morbidities of radiation therapy include but are not limited to an increased susceptibility to dental caries and periodontal disease. They also include profound and often permanent functional and sensory changes involving the oral soft tissue. These changes range from oral mucositis experienced during and soon after treatment, mucosal opportunistic infections, neurosensory disorders, and tissue fibrosis. Many of the oral soft tissue changes following radiation therapy are difficult challenges to the patients and their caregivers and require life‐long strategies to alleviate their deleterious effect on basic life functions and on the quality of life. We discuss the presentation, prognosis, and management strategies of the dental structure and oral soft tissue morbidities resulting from the administration of therapeutic radiation in head and neck patient.

During a decade of research semi-structured interviews of healers, collectors and sellers of medicinal plants were conducted. Bioassays were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of the plants found. The majority (83%) of the 510 species used were native to Peru. 50% of the plants used in the colonial era disappeared from the pharmacopoeia. In the markets, vendors were grouped: common and exotic plants, plants for common diseases, plants only used by healers, and plants with magical purposes. About 974 preparations with up to 29 ingredients treated 164 conditions. Nearly 65% of the medicinal flora are applied in mixtures. Antibacterial activity was confirmed in most plants used for infections. 24% aqueous extract and 76% ethanol extracts showed toxicity. Traditional methods of preparation take this into account when choosing the appropriate solvent for the preparation of a remedy. The growing demand did not increase the significant cultivation of medicinal plants. The majority represent plants collected in nature, causing doubts about the sustainability of trade.The focus of ethnobotanical studies and the participation of local stakeholders have changed a lot in recent decades. From the scientific point of view, the research has gone from simple inventories for example of mainly medicinal plants to detailed quantitative studies, often focused on all useful plants. However, the most important thing is that the research has finally moved away from colonial style research to modern ethnobotany based on the principles of the Nagoya Protocol. This is of great importance for the ethnobiological community. However, these changes have not been the same in all Latin American countries, and there are large regional differences.The objective of this publication is to provide examples of twenty-five years of global research, describing the change of attitude and methodology during that time, highlighting the increasing role of local actors in ethnobotanical research and contributing ideas for the future development of the discipline.With this special issue of Ethnobotany Research and Applications we try to bring 20 years of research in Northern Peru to a wider audience.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,none,2.0

We evaluated whether the change of DESIGN‐R (rating) score could predict subsequent healing, and determined the optimal cutoff points. In a multicenter prospective cohort study, patients were followed until wound healing or censoring. Wound severity was evaluated by the DESIGN‐R tool every week, and the score change was calculated over 1–4 weeks ( n = 411, 286, 224, and 170, respectively). In the multivariate analyses stratified by depth, a one‐point improvement in DESIGN‐R score over any period was positively associated with healing within the next 30 days independent of initial wound severity (hazard ratios over each 1–4 weeks ranging from 1.16 to 1.33 for superficial ulcers and from 1.21 to 1.27 for deep ulcers; all p &lt; 0.05). The optimal cutoff points over 1–4 weeks were set as negative change for superficial ulcers and as positive change of ≥two points for deep ulcers. Nonhealing rate was higher for ulcers with DESIGN‐R score change below the cutoff points than that aforementioned for both depths. Weekly monitoring by the DESIGN‐R tool will be advantageous for evaluating prognosis of pressure ulcers independent of initial wound severity and depth.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,general,none,0.0

39037876,10.1109/TMI.2024.3428836,Interpretable Severity Scoring of Pelvic Trauma Through Automated Fracture Detection and Bayesian Inference.,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2025.0,"Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are potentially lethal mainly due to associated injuries and massive pelvic hemorrhage. The severity of pelvic fractures in trauma victims is frequently assessed by grading the fracture according to the Tile AO/OTA classification in whole-body Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Due to the high volume of whole-body CT scans generated in trauma centers, the overall information content of a single whole-body CT scan and low manual CT reading speed, an automatic approach to Tile classification would provide substantial value, e.g., to prioritize the reading sequence of the trauma radiologists or enable them to focus on other major injuries in multi-trauma patients. In such a high-stakes scenario, an automated method for Tile grading should ideally be transparent such that the symbolic information provided by the method follows the same logic a radiologist or orthopedic surgeon would use to determine the fracture grade. This paper introduces an automated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist radiologists in fracture detection and Tile grading. To achieve interpretability despite processing high-dimensional whole-body CT images, we design a neurosymbolic algorithm that operates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans. The algorithm first detects relevant pelvic fractures on CTs with high specificity using Faster-RCNN. To generate robust fracture detections and associated detection (un)certainties, we perform test-time augmentation of the CT scans to apply fracture detection several times in a self-ensembling approach. The fracture detections are interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical best practices to infer an initial Tile grade. We apply a Bayesian causal model to recover likely co-occurring fractures that may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating point of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and corresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides fracture location and types, as well as information on important counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation. Our approach achieves an AUC of 0.89/0.74 for translational and rotational instability,which is comparable to radiologist performance. Despite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not compromise on performance compared to previous black-box methods.",PubMed,0,1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,6.5
38934520,10.4081/aiua.2024.12703,Management of urinary stones: state of the art and future perspectives by experts in stone disease.,"Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",2024.0,"To present state of the art on the management of urinary stones from a panel of globally recognized urolithiasis experts who met during the Experts in Stone Disease Congress in Valencia in January 2024. Options of treatment: The surgical treatment modalities of renal and ureteral stones are well defined by the guidelines of international societies, although for some index cases more alternative options are possible. For 1.5 cm renal stones, both m-PCNL and RIRS have proven to be valid treatment alternatives with comparable stone-free rates. The m-PCNL has proven to be more cost effective and requires a shorter operative time, while the RIRS has demonstrated lower morbidity in terms of blood loss and shorter recovery times. SWL has proven to be less effective at least for lower calyceal stones but has the highest safety profile. For a 6mm obstructing stone of the pelviureteric junction (PUJ) stone, SWL should be the first choice for a stone less than 1 cm, due to less invasiveness and lower risk of complications although it has a lower stone free-rate. RIRS has advantages in certain conditions such as anticoagulant treatment, obesity, or body deformity. Technical issues of the surgical procedures for stone removal: In patients receiving antithrombotic therapy, SWL, PCN and open surgery are at elevated risk of hemorrhage or perinephric hematoma. URS, is associated with less morbidity in these cases. An individualized combined evaluation of risks of bleeding and thromboembolism should determine the perioperative thromboprophylactic strategy. Pre-interventional urine culture and antibiotic therapy are mandatory although UTI treatment is becoming more challenging due to increasing resistance to routinely applied antibiotics. The use of an intrarenal urine culture and stone culture is recommended to adapt antibiotic therapy in case of postoperative infectious complications. Measurements of temperature and pressure during RIRS are vital for ensuring patient safety and optimizing surgical outcomes although techniques of measurements and methods for data analysis are still to be refined. Ureteral stents were improved by the development of new biomaterials, new coatings, and new stent designs. Topics of current research are the development of drug eluting and bioresorbable stents. Complications of endoscopic treatment: PCNL is considered the most invasive surgical option. Fever and sepsis were observed in 11 and 0.5% and need for transfusion and embolization for bleeding in 7 and 0.4%. Major complications, as colonic, splenic, liver, gall bladder and bowel injuries are quite rare but are associated with significant morbidity. Ureteroscopy causes less complications, although some of them can be severe. They depend on high pressure in the urinary tract (sepsis or renal bleeding) or application of excessive force to the urinary tract (ureteral avulsion or stricture). Diagnostic work up:  Genetic testing consents the diagnosis of monogenetic conditions causing stones. It should be carried out in children and in selected adults. In adults, monogenetic diseases can be diagnosed by systematic genetic testing in no more than 4%, when cystinuria, APRT deficiency, and xanthinuria are excluded. A reliable stone analysis by infrared spectroscopy or X-ray diffraction is mandatory and should be associated to examination of the stone under a stereomicroscope. The analysis of digital images of stones by deep convolutional neural networks in dry laboratory or during endoscopic examination could allow the classification of stones based on their color and texture. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in association with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) is another fundamental research tool for the study of kidney stones. The combination of metagenomic analysis using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques and the enhanced quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol can be used to evaluate the urobiome of renal stone formers. Twenty-four hour urine analysis has a place during patient evaluation together with repeated measurements of urinary pH with a digital pH meter. Urinary supersaturation is the most comprehensive physicochemical risk factor employed in urolithiasis research. Urinary macromolecules can act as both promoters or inhibitors of stone formation depending on the chemical composition of urine in which they are operating. At the moment, there are no clinical applications of macromolecules in stone management or prophylaxis. Patients should be evaluated for the association with systemic pathologies.",PubMed,0,5,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,9.5

Clinicians have few tools to predict which patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage on their initial head computed tomography (hCT) scan will progress. The objective of this investigation was to identify clinical, imaging, and/or protein biomarkers associated with progression of intracranial hemorrhage (PICH) after moderate/severe TBI and to create an accurate predictive model of PICH based on clinical features available at presentation. We analyzed a subset of subjects from the phase II double-blind, multi-center, randomized ""Prehospital Tranexamic Acid Use for TBI"" trial. This subset was limited to the placebo arm of the parent trial with evidence of hemorrhage on the initial hCT and a follow-up hCT 6 h after. PICH was defined as an increase in hemorrhage size by 30% or more, or the development of new hemorrhage in the intra- and extra-axial intracranial vault between the initial and the follow-up hCT. Two independent radiologists evaluated each hCT, and conflicts were adjudicated by a third. Clinical and radiographic characteristics were collected, along with plasma protein biomarkers at admission. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, and each principal component (PC) was interrogated for its association with PICH. Finally, expert opinion and recursive feature extraction (RFE) were used to select input features for the construction of several supervised classification models.

However, as opposed to other standardized radiology reporting systems, a visual overview and data to support the proposed standardized lexicon are lacking. We used over 4000 admission computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with TBI from the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study to develop an extensive pictorial overview of the NINDS TBI CDEs, with visual examples and background information on individual pathoanatomical lesion types, up to the level of supplemental and emerging information (e.g., location and estimated volumes). We documented the frequency of lesion occurrence, aiming to quantify the relative importance of different CDEs for characterizing TBI, and performed a critical appraisal of our experience with the intent to inform updating of the CDEs. In addition, we investigated the co-occurrence and clustering of lesion types and the distribution of six CT classification systems. The median age of the 4087 patients in our dataset was 50 years (interquartile range, 29-66; range, 0-96), including 238 patients under 18 years old (5.8%). Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (45.3%), skull fractures (37.4%), contusions (31.3%), and acute subdural hematoma (28.9%) were the most frequently occurring CT findings in acute TBI. The ranking of these lesions was the same in patients with mild TBI (baseline Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 13-15) compared with those with moderate-severe TBI (baseline GCS score 3-12), but the frequency of occurrence was up to three times higher in moderate-severe TBI. In most TBI patients with CT abnormalities, there was co-occurrence and clustering of different lesion types, with significant differences between mild and moderate-severe TBI patients. More specifically, lesion patterns were more complex in moderate-severe TBI patients, with more co-existing lesions and more frequent signs of mass effect. These patients also had higher and more heterogeneous CT score distributions, associated with worse predicted outcomes. The critical appraisal of the NINDS CDEs was highly positive, but revealed that full assessment can be time consuming, that some CDEs had very low frequencies, and identified a few redundancies and ambiguity in some definitions. Whilst primarily developed for research, implementation of CDE templates for use in clinical practice is advocated, but this will require development of an abbreviated version. In conclusion, with this study, we provide an educational resource for clinicians and researchers to help assess, characterize, and report the vast and complex spectrum of imaging findings in patients with TBI. Our data provides a comprehensive overview of the contemporary landscape of TBI imaging pathology in Europe, and the findings can serve as empirical evidence for updating the current NINDS radiologic CDEs to version 3.0.",PubMed,0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,3.5

Fundamental to this resource is the data dictionary, which is an ontology of data items. Here, we report the systematic review and consensus process for inclusion of biological markers in the data dictionary. Standardized database searches were implemented from inception through April 2022. English-language studies evaluating association between a fluid, tissue, or imaging marker and any clinical outcome in at least 10 patients with moderate-severe TBI were included. Records were screened using a prioritization algorithm and saturation threshold in Research Screener. Full-length records were then screened in Covidence. A pre-defined algorithm was used to assign a judgement of predictive value to each observed association, and high-value predictors were discussed in a consensus process. Searches retrieved 106,593 records; 1,417 full-length records were screened, resulting in 546 included records. Two hundred thirty-nine individual markers were extracted, evaluated against 101 outcomes. Forty-one markers were judged to be high-value predictors of 15 outcomes. Fluid markers retained following the consensus process included ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), S100, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Imaging markers included computed tomography (CT) scores (e.g., Marshall scores), pathological observations (e.g., hemorrhage, midline shift), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification (e.g., diffuse axonal injury). Clinical context and time of sampling of potential predictive indicators are important considerations for utility.

In mice, the greatest changes in gene expression were seen in monocytes across both compartments. After systemic injury, the gene expression pattern of monocytes markedly deviated from steady state with corresponding changes in critical transcription factors, which can be traced back to myeloid progenitors. These changes were largely recapitulated in the human single-cell analysis. We generalized the major changes in human CD14+ monocytes into 6 signatures, which further defined 2 trauma patient subtypes (SG1 vs. SG2) identified in the whole-blood leukocyte transcriptome in the initial 12 hours after injury.

Thus, intervention by bystanders, who may lack medical training, may be necessary to save a victim's life in situations with bleeding injuries. Proper intervention requires that bystanders accurately assess the severity of the injury and respond appropriately. As many bystanders lack tools and training, they are limited in terms of the information they can use in their evaluative process. In hemorrhage situations, visible blood loss may serve as a dominant cue to action. Therefore, understanding how medically untrained bystanders (i.e., laypeople) perceive hemorrhage is important. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the ability of laypeople to visually assess blood loss and to examine factors that may impact accuracy and the classification of injury severity. A total of 125 laypeople watched 78 short videos each of individuals experiencing a hemorrhage. Victim gender, volume of blood lost, and camera perspective were systematically manipulated in the videos. The results revealed that laypeople overestimated small volumes of blood loss (from 50 to 200 ml), and underestimated larger volumes (from 400 to 1900 ml).

This type of procedure is perceived as routine and devoid of substantial risks, but uncommon complications can occur and need to be addressed with careful workup. CASE REPORT A FNAC procedure for a young female patient with multiple thyroid nodules was requested by her general practitioner. After the FNAC thyroid procedure, a carotid wall hematoma was suspected and could not be excluded with ultrasound (US) alone. Thus, the patient underwent a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) that excluded blood extravasation from the carotid, confirming the suspicion of perivascular blood accumulation. As a precaution, the patient was hospitalized, with US follow-up; she was dismissed the day after her hospital admission with a diagnosis of a benign thyroid nodule in multinodular goiter according to SIAPEC-IAP classification. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights how a routine-perceived procedure such as FNAC could present a challenge to the performing physicians, pathologist, and radiologist, raising the suspicion of a severe complication that needs to be addressed with a readily available emergency service that may be accessible only within a central hospital-level organization. This case reinforces the point that more careful adherence to clinic-radiological guidelines is needed to avoid potentially inappropriate and harmful procedures.

Severity classification is based on the Glasgow Coma Scale. However, the neurological worsening in an acute setting does not always correspond to the initial severity suggesting an underestimation of the real magnitude of the injury. Objective: To study the correlation between the initial severity according to the Glasgow Coma Scale and the patient outcome in the context of different clinical and tomography variables. Materials and methods: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 490 patients with closed traumatic brain injury requiring a stay in the intensive care unit of two third-level hospitals in Barranquilla. The risk was estimated by calculating the OR (95% CI). The significance level was established at an alpha value of 0.05. Results: Forty-one percent of all patients required orotracheal intubation; 51.2% were initially classified with moderate trauma and 6,0% as mild. The delay in the aggressive management of the traumas affected mainly those patients with traumas classified as moderate in whom lethality increased to 100% when there was delay in the detection of the neurological worsening and in the establishment of the aggressive treatment beyond 4 to 8 hours while the lethality in patients who received this treatment within the first hour reduced to <20%.

It is estimated that congenital fibrinogen disorder accounts for 8% of rare coagulation factor deficiencies. Most of congenital fibrinogen disorders are suspected in individuals with bleeding tendency or coincidentally discovered, for instance prior to surgery. Fibrinogen disorders could be also found in patients with thrombotic events, impaired wound healing, and recurrent spontaneous abortions. Afibrinogenemia manifests as mild to severe bleeding, while hypofibrinogenemia is often asymptomatic. Dysfibrinogenemia, a qualitative fibrinogen disorder, is associated with bleeding, thrombosis, or with no symptoms. Recent recommendations issued by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in 2018 do not encourage routine evaluation of thrombin time or other coagulation tests in patients with suspected congenital fibrinogen disorders, highlighting the value of fibrinogen antigen measurement and genetic analysis, added to the key finding, that is, reduced fibrinogen concentration determined with a coagulometric assay.

According to the difference of red blood cell count in urinary sediment and quantitative of 24-hour urinary protein (24 h-UP) during renal biopsy, the patients were grouped in 3 ways: a simple hematuria group, a hematuria and proteinuria group, and a simple proteinuria group; a proteinuria I group, a proteinuria II group, and a proteinuria III group; a hematuria I group, a hematuria II group, and a hematuria III group. The clinical parameters such as age, mean arterial pressure, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, blood uric acid, 24 h-UP, and renal pathological damage were compared.  Results: A total of 157 patients met the inclusion criteria, including 71 males and 86 females. The most common pathological type was focal and/or segmental glomerulosclerosis. The Lee's classification were dominated by grade III and IV, and the renal pathological injury was heavy. Immunoglobulin deposition was dominated by simple IgA deposition. The most common fluorescence intensity of IgA deposition was +++. 97 (61.78%) patients were accompanied by complement deposition and were mainly composed of simple complement C3 deposition. There were 18 patients (11.47%) in the simple hematuria group, 111 patients (70.70%) in the hematuria and proteinuria group, and 28 patients (17.83%) in the simple proteinuria group. Compared with the simple hematuria group, the proportion of patients with mild injury was lower in the simple proteinuria group, and the proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe injuries was increased (χ2=7.053, P=0.008). Compared with the hematuria and proteinuria group, the proportion of patients with mild injury was lower in the simple proteinuria group, and the proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe injury was increased (χ2=4.294, P=0.038).

However, the surgical outcomes and recurrence of CSDH in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) remain unknown. METHODS: A nationwide population-based cohort study was retrospectively conducted using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The study included 29,163 patients who underwent first-time craniostomy for CSDH removal between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2013. In total, 1223 patients with LC and 2446 matched non-LC control patients were eligible for analysis. All-cause mortality, surgical complications, repeat craniostomy, extended craniotomy, and long-term medical costs were analyzed. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate (8.7% vs 3.1% for patients with LC and non-LC patients, respectively), frequency of hospital admission, length of ICU stay, number of blood transfusions, and medical expenditures of patients with LC who underwent craniostomy for CSDH were considerably higher than those of non-LC control patients. Patients with LC tended to require an extended craniotomy to remove subdural hematomas in the hospital or during long-term follow-up. The surgical outcome worsened with an increase in the severity of LC.

The authors thus aimed to assess the effect of case volume on the rate of various types of complications after clipping of UIAs. METHODS Using information on the outcomes of inpatient admissions for surgical clipping of UIAs collected within a national database, the relationship of institutional case volume to the incidence of different types of complications after clipping was investigated. Complications were subdivided into different categories, which included all complications, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, medical complications, infectious complications, complications related to anesthesia, and wound complications. The relationship of case volume to different types of complications was assessed using linear regression analysis. The relationships between case volume and overall complication and stroke rates were fit with both linear and quadratic equations. The numerical cutoff for institutional case volume above and below which the authors found the greatest differences in mean overall complication and stroke rate was determined using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. RESULTS Between October 2012 and September 2015, 125 health care institutions reported patient outcomes from a total of 6040 cases of clipping of UIAs.

The authors sought to review a single-institution experience from a public health perspective to gain a better understanding of the local population affected, determine overall incidence and seasonal trends, and provide details on the initial hospitalization, including extent of injuries, neurosurgical interventions, and hospital charges. METHODS All cases of AHT involving patients who presented to Le Bonheur Children's Hospital (LBCH) from 2009 through 2014 were identified. AHT was defined as skull fracture or intracranial hemorrhage in a child under the age of 5 years with a suspicious mechanism or evidence of other intentional injuries, such as retinal hemorrhages, old or new fractures, or soft-tissue bruising. Injuries were categorized as Grade I (skull fracture only), Grade II (intracranial hemorrhage or edema not requiring surgical intervention), or Grade III (intracranial hemorrhage requiring intervention or death due to brain injury). RESULTS Two hundred thirteen AHT cases were identified. The demographics of the study population are similar to those reported in the literature: the majority of the patients involved were 6 months of age or younger (55%), male (61%), African American (47%), and publicly insured (82%). One hundred one neurosurgical procedures were performed in 58 children, with the most common being bur hole placement for treatment of subdural collections (25%) and decompressive hemicraniectomy (22%). The annual incidence rate rose from 2009 (19.6 cases per 100,000 in the population under 5 years of age) to 2014 (47.4 cases per 100,000) and showed seasonal peaks in January, July, and October (6-year average single-month incidence, respectively, 24.7, 21.7, and 24.7 per 100,000). The total hospital charges were $13,014,584, with a median cost of $27,939. Treatment costs for children who required surgical intervention (i.e., those with Grade III) were up to 10 times those of children with less severe injuries. CONCLUSIONS In the authors' local population, victims of AHT are overwhelmingly infants, are more often male than female, and are disproportionately from lower socioeconomic ranks. The incidence is increasing and initial hospitalization charges are substantial and variable.

Many patients with intracranial bleeding are treated too late, because they initially show no symptoms of severe injury and are not transported to a trauma center. There is a need for a method to detect intracranial bleedings in the prehospital setting. In this study, we investigate whether broadband microwave technology (MWT) in conjunction with a diagnostic algorithm can detect subdural hematoma (SDH). A human cranium phantom and numerical simulations of SDH are used. Four phantoms with SDH 0, 40, 70 and 110 mL are measured with a MWT instrument. The simulated dataset consists of 1500 observations. Classification accuracy is assessed using fivefold cross-validation, and a validation dataset never used for training. The total accuracy is 100 and 82-96 % for phantom measurements and simulated data, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for bleeding detection were 100 and 96 %, respectively, for the simulated data. SDH of different sizes is differentiated. The classifier requires training dataset size in order of 150 observations per class to achieve high accuracy. We conclude that the results indicate that MWT can detect and estimate the size of SDH.

A retrospective observational study was performed in the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Patients hospitalized for acute subdural hemorrhage were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes. Patients with coexisting psychiatric diagnoses were identified. Outcomes studied included mortality and adverse discharge disposition. In OSPHD, diagnoses of depression (OR = 0.64, p < 0.001), bipolar disorder (OR = 0.45, p < 0.05), and anxiety (OR = 0.37, p < 0.001) were associated with reduced mortality during hospitalization for TBI, with a trend toward psychosis (OR = 0.56, p = 0.08).

In this study, three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were used to quantify the anatomical distribution of lesions, to grade DAI according to the Adams grading system, and to evaluate the value of lesion localization in combination with clinical prognostic factors to improve outcome prediction. Thirty patients (mean 31.2 years ±14.3 standard deviation) with severe DAI (Glasgow Motor Score [GMS] <6) examined with MRI within 1 week post-injury were included. Diffusion-weighted (DW), T2*-weighted gradient echo and susceptibility-weighted (SWI) sequences were used. Extended Glasgow outcome score was assessed after 6 months. Number of DW lesions in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and internal capsule and number of SWI lesions in the mesencephalon correlated significantly with outcome in univariate analysis. Age, GMS at admission, GMS at discharge, and low proportion of good monitoring time with cerebral perfusion pressure <60 mm Hg correlated significantly with outcome in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed an independent relation with poor outcome for age (p = 0.005) and lesions in the mesencephalic region corresponding to substantia nigra and tegmentum on SWI (p = 0.008). We conclude that higher age and lesions in substantia nigra and mesencephalic tegmentum indicate poor long-term outcome in DAI.

Because of the high risk of intracranial bleeding, life-long prophylaxis, preferably using FXIII concentrate, is mandatory. In FXIII-B subunit deficiency the bleeding diathesis is mild to moderate. FXIII deficiency is frequently associated with impaired wound healing. Women suffering from FXIII deficiency cannot carry pregnancies to term; in severe cases spontaneous abortion occurs in the first trimester. Plasma-derived heat-inactivated FXIII concentrate and recombinant FXIII-A are available for prophylaxis; a 4 weekly dose of 35 to 40 U/kg is recommended and a trough level of greater than 5% FXIII activity should be aimed for. During pregnancy, 2 weekly prophylaxis with a target trough level of greater than 10% is recommended, and during labor FXIII activity should exceed 30%. During surgical procedures, the target should be higher than 50% FXIII activity. Alloantibodies make FXIII deficiency difficult to manage, but fortunately they are extremely rare. Acquired FXIII deficiency may involve both subunits. Autoantibodies against FXIII subunits also manifest in severe bleeding complication with a relatively high mortality rate. The first-line test in the diagnosis of FXIII deficiency should be a quantitative functional assay based on the measurement of ammonia release or amine incorporation. The sensitivity of the traditional clot solubility assay is not sufficiently robust to enable proper screening. Antigen assays are needed for the classification of FXIII deficiencies. In the case of anti-FXIII antibodies, the diagnostic armory should be supplemented by a mixing test/Bethesda-type inhibitor assay and by assays that detect/measure the binding of antibodies to FXIII and to its subunits.",PubMed,0,4,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,10.0

Massive transfusion (MT), defined as the transfusion of at least 10 units of red blood cells within 24 h of hospital admission, has served as a conventional surrogate that has been used to develop early predictive algorithms and establish criteria for ordering an MT protocol from the blood bank. However, the conventional MT rule is a poor proxy, because it is likely to misclassify many severely hemorrhaging trauma patients as they could die before receiving the 10th red blood cells transfusion. In this article, we propose to use a latent class model to obtain a more accurate and complete metric in the presence of early death. Our new approach incorporates baseline patient information from the time of hospital admission, by combining respective models for survival time and usage of blood products transfused within the framework of latent class analysis. To account for statistical challenges, caused by induced dependent censoring inherent in 24-h sums of transfusions, we propose to estimate an improved standard via a pseudo-likelihood function using an expectation-maximization algorithm with the inverse weighting principle. We evaluated the performance of our new standard in simulation studies and compared with the conventional MT definition using actual patient data from the Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion study.

A new classification of complications, initiated in 1992, was updated 5 years ago. It is based on the type of therapy needed to correct the complication. The principle of the classification was to be simple, reproducible, flexible, and applicable irrespective of the cultural background. The aim of the current study was to critically evaluate this classification from the perspective of its use in the literature, by assessing interobserver variability in grading complex complication scenarios and to correlate the classification grades with patients', nurses', and doctors' perception.Reports from the literature using the classification system were systematically analyzed. Next, 11 scenarios illustrating difficult cases were prepared to develop a consensus on how to rank the various complications. Third, 7 centers from different continents, having routinely used the classification, independently assessed the 11 scenarios. An agreement analysis was performed to test the accuracy and reliability of the classification. Finally, the perception of the severity was tested in patients, nurses, and physicians by presenting 30 scenarios, each illustrating a specific grade of complication.We noted a dramatic increase in the use of the classification in many fields of surgery. About half of the studies used the contracted form, whereas the rest used the full range of grading. Two-thirds of the publications avoided subjective terms such as minor or major complications. The study of 11 difficult cases among various centers revealed a high degree of agreement in identifying and ranking complications (89% agreement), and enabled a better definition of unclear situations. Each grade of complications significantly correlated with the perception by patients, nurses, and physicians (P < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test).This 5-year evaluation provides strong evidence that the classification is valid and applicable worldwide in many fields of surgery.

Because of the paucity of recent prospective randomized trials on the evaluation and management of penetrating chest injury, the current algorithms and recommendations are based on available published cohort, observational and retrospective studies, and the expert opinion of the Western Trauma Association members. The two algorithms should be reviewed in the following sequence: Figure 1 for the management and damage-control strategies in the unstable patient and Figure 2 for the management and definitive repair strategies in the stable patient. Figure 1 will discuss damage-control techniques; Figure 2 will focus on more definitive repairs. Because of the variety of possible mechanisms, presentation, injury sites, and operative approaches, we recognize that there will be variability in decision making, local resources, institutional consensus, and patient-specific factors that may require deviation from the algorithms presented. The algorithms and accompanying text represent our consensus for a safe and reasonable approach in these complex cases and attempts to incorporate historically validated approaches with the advent of newer imaging, interventional, resuscitative, operative, and selective/expectant management approaches.Figure 1: Management of the stable patient.Figure 2: Management of the unstable patient.Historical Perspective The precise incidence of penetrating chest injury, varies depending on the urban environment and the nature of the review. Overall, penetrating chest injuries account for 1% to 13% of trauma admissions, and acute exploration is required in 5% to 15% of cases; exploration is required in 15% to 30% of patients who are unstable or in whom active hemorrhage is suspected. Among patients managed by tube thoracostomy alone, complications including retained hemothorax, empyema, persistent air leak, and/or occult diaphragmatic injuries range from 25% to 30%.1–6 In civilian practice, this low incidence has been generally attributed to ""low-kinetic energy"" mechanisms. In zones of conflict, among properly outfitted soldiers, body armor also results in a lower requirement for operation and incidence of complications.1,5,6 The reported incidence of specific injuries also varies, depending on site and characterization of the patient population. Demetriades7 reported an overall incidence of great vessel injury of 5.3% following gunshot wounds and 2% after stab wounds to the chest. Rhee et al.8 described an overall incidence of penetrating cardiac injuries as 1 per 210 admissions. Sixty-five percent of the patients admitted to the University of Louisville with peristernal penetrating injuries sustained a cardiac injury.9 In patients requiring urgent (non–emergency department) thoracotomy, cardiac injuries are found in approximately 16% to 52% following stab wounds and 10% to 37% following gunshot wounds, and lung injuries are found in 30% to 59% of stab wounds and 65% to 86% of gunshot wounds.10–12 It is clear that mortality is significantly impacted by preadmission hypotension, the ability to perform aggressive resuscitation and operative intervention, and appropriate imaging in stable patients.13,14 Focusing on blood products rather than crystalloids and in some settings ""hypotensive"" resuscitation seems to have a survival benefit.6 Anatomy The simplest anatomic classification is based on the likelihood of specific organ injury. Classically, penetrating injuries between the nipple lines anteriorly or the scapula posteriorly have the potential for cardiac or great vessel injury. The ""danger zone"" has been described as the region between the epigastrium to the sternal notch and laterally within 3 cm of the sternum.9,15 Injuries below the level of the tip of the scapula posteriorly or the inframammary crease/nipple anteriorly have the potential to traverse the diaphragm, particularly left lower thoracic injuries.1 As many as 20% of patients with penetrating injuries will have associated abdominal injuries.14 Unfortunately, particularly with gunshot wounds, any region of the chest may be affected, and these anatomic relationships should only be considered as generalizations. Presentation The presentation and management of a patient of penetrating trauma depends on three interrelated factors: stability, mechanism, and location of the wound. For the purposes of this discussion, stability requires that the airway be secure (with or without intubation), that the patient is both oxygenating and ventilating at an acceptable level, and that continued hemodynamic stability is documented. Patients with evidence of shock or impending collapse (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg and/or persistent tachycardia > 120 beats per minute, not explained by pain or anxiety and/or persistent hypoxemia) should be managed by airway control combined with aggressive blood product resuscitation. In essence, a stable patient is one in whom there is time to consider different diagnostic and therapeutic options; the unstable patient is one in whom the approach is predicated on getting to the operating room as soon as possible with minimal delay for extraneous testing. This excludes the agonal patient. Clearly, there are times when the scenarios overlap (e.g., transmediastinal gunshot wound with suspicion of tamponade), and the pathways described are not mutually exclusive. Incisions and Approaches There are a number of different approaches that can be used involving variations in incision, airway management, and positioning. The choice is dictated by stability, mechanism, and surgeon preference/experience. A brief review of these is presented in Table 1. In an unstable patient, the optimal positioning is supine in the crucifix position, with the patient draped to include the neck, supraclavicular area, entire thorax, abdomen, and proximal thighs. A single-lumen tube is the optimal initial airway tool in chest trauma. The tube can be advanced into the left main stem bronchus to isolate the right lung, or an endobronchial blocker can be placed to isolate the left. Advancing a single-lumen tube into the right often causes obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus. This rapid isolation can be particularly useful in patients with massive unilateral air leak and/or hemorrhage. A double-lumen tube can be used in stable patients who require lung isolation or in centers that are facile with emergent placement. In patients who present in severe shock and/or require massive volume resuscitation, it may not be possible to ""switch out"" the double-lumen tube at the end of the case because of tenuous oxygenation/ventilation status.

Hemophilia A is more common, occurring in 1:5000 male births, whereas hemophilia B occurs in 1:30,000 male births. Hemophilia is found in all ethnic groups; there is no geographic or racial predilection. Although easy bruising and excessive mucosal bleeding may be the first signs of hemophilia, severe soft tissue bleeding and hemarthroses are the classic bleeding symptoms. Other bleeding disorders should be considered when evaluating a child with unexpected bleeding. Factor deficiencies (FV, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII, and fibrinogen) may present with bleeding or abnormal coagulation laboratory test results. von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency in von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is released from endothelial cells at the site of vascular injury. Because there are 3 subtypes (which are different in both severity and heredity), clinical symptoms vary from mild mucosal bleeding to hemarthroses. If a bleeding disorder appears to be acquired, nutritional deficiencies (especially vitamin K) or associated illnesses (disseminated intravascular coagulation or liver disease) should be considered. Platelet disorders, either quantitative or qualitative defects, present with mucocutaneous bleeding. In the evaluation of a suspected platelet disorder, medications and systemic diseases that affect platelet function should also be considered.The primary function of the coagulation system is to maintain the integrity of the endothelium while preserving vasculature patency. The basal state of the coagulation system is nonthrombogenic for 2 main reasons: the coagulation factors circulate in their inactivated forms and the endothelium is nonthrombogenic. Disruption of the endothelium causes exposure of the thrombophilic subendothelium and initiation of the hemostatic mechanism. The classic pathway of coagulation has been replaced by a cell-based model of coagulation (Figure 1) in which tissue factor (TF), platelets, and thrombin play key roles in initiating, amplifying and propagating clot formation.Hemostasis involves the complex interaction of platelets with the vessel wall mediated primarily by collagen in low-shear (venous) and VWF in high-shear (arterioles) circuits, both serving an adhesive function in bridging platelets to the subendothelium, where the coagulation proteins dock to phospholipid sites on the surface of activated platelets, resulting in fibrin-generating concentrations of thrombin.Coagulation is typically triggered after the exposure of TF, found in the subendothelium, which binds circulating activated (a) FVII. The TF-FVIIa complex activates zymogen FX and FIX to FXa and FIXa, respectively. FXa converts prothrombin (FII) to thrombin (FIIa). The picomolar quantities of FIIa generated on the TF-bearing cell surface releases FVIII from its carrier protein VWF and activates it to FVIIIa. Thrombin also activates platelets, exposing a negatively charged phospholipid-rich surface capable of binding coagulation proteins, including FIXa, previously generated on TF-bearing cell surface. FIXa along with cofactor FVIIIa, calcium, and phospholipids form the Tenase complex, recruit FX to the complex, and activate it to FXa. FXa along with calcium and phospholipids form the prothrombinase complex, which in turn converts large quantities of prothrombin to thrombin, such that fibrinogen is converted to fibrin monomers. Thrombin also activates FXIII, which cross-links the fibrin monomers to stabilize the clot, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, which prevents clot breakdown, both improving clot firmness.Theoretical consideration of the classic or waterfall view of coagulation is useful in interpreting the results of prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) used as screening tools to evaluate patients with hemorrhage or a tendency for hemorrhage (Table 1). The intrinsic system consists of FXII and FXI, which along with high-molecular-weight kininogen and prekallikrein form the contact pathway, and FVIII and FIX. The extrinsic system is composed of TF and FVII. The common pathway includes FX, FV, thrombin, and fibrinogen.The genes encoding FVIII and FIX are on the long arm of the X chromosome. Hemophilia A and B are the only hereditary clotting diseases inherited in a sex-linked recessive pattern. All female children of a father with hemophilia will be carriers, whereas none of his sons will be affected. Further, the sons of a carrier mother have a 50% chance of disease, whereas the daughters will have a 50% chance of being a carrier (Figure 2).The genetic mutations cause a quantitative decrease in protein expression, a qualitative decrease in protein activity, or both. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with hemophilia A and 40% to 50% of patients with hemophilia B make a dysfunctional protein, which results in decreased protein activity without a quantitative decrease. More than 1000 mutations in either the factor 8 or factor 9 genes have been identified to cause clinical hemophilia. There is a high rate of spontaneous mutation (approximately one-third of cases) such that even in the absence of a family history, hemophilia should be suspected in a newborn with bleeding and a prolongation in the PTT. Through lyonization of the X chromosome, females with Turner syndrome or X chromosomal mosaicism may have bleeding disorders secondary to reduction in either FVIII or FIX activity.The reduced level or activity of FVIII or FIX results in dysfunctional clotting. In patients without hemophilia, FVIIIa and FIXa associate on the surface of activated platelets and form the Tenase complex, which leads to the formation of thrombin and subsequently a fibrin clot. Because both FVIIIa and FIXa are required for Tenase formation, the clinical manifestations when either factor is dysfunctional are the same.Disease classification is based on the residual factor level, which correlates to bleeding symptoms (Table 2). By convention, the percentage activity of each of the factors is based on the World Health Organization standard. By this standard, 1 mL of normal plasma has 1 IU/dL of each factor activity. Normal plasma is thought to have 100% activity, but in reality the lower limit of normal for individuals without hemophilia is",OpenAlex,0,16,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,24.0

The Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee is composed of Society members who are chosen because they have demonstrated expertise in the specialty of colon and rectal surgery. This committee was created to lead international efforts in defining quality care for conditions related to the colon, rectum, and anus. This is accompanied by developing Clinical Practice Guidelines based on the best available evidence. These guidelines are inclusive and not prescriptive. Their purpose is to provide information on which decisions can be made rather than to dictate a specific form of treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners, healthcare workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Symptoms related to hemorrhoids are very common in the Western hemisphere and other industrialized societies. Although published estimates of prevalence are varied,1,2 it represents one of the most common medical and surgical disease processes encountered in the United States, resulting in >2.2-million outpatient evaluations per year.3 A large number of diverse symptoms may be, correctly or incorrectly, attributed to hemorrhoids by both patients and referring physicians. As a result, it is important to identify symptomatic hemorrhoids as the underlying source of the anorectal symptom and to have a clear understanding of the evaluation and management of this disease process. These guidelines address both diagnostic and therapeutic modalities in the management of hemorrhoidal disease. METHODOLOGY These guidelines are built on the ASCRS Practice Parameters for the Management of Hemorrhoids published in 2011.4 A literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews was performed, expanding on the previous literature search from 1996 and updated through April 2017 (see Supplemental Search Strategy, https://links.lww.com/DCR/A532). Key word combinations included hemorrhoid, internal and external hemorrhoids, hemorrhoid disease, thrombosed hemorrhoid, rubber band ligation, hemorrhoidopexy, procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH), and stapled hemorrhoidopexy, Doppler-guided hemorrhoidopexy, hemorrhoidectomy, Milligan–Morgan, and Ferguson. Directed searches of the embedded references from the primary articles were also performed in selected circumstances. The final source material used was evaluated for the methodologic quality, the evidence base was examined, and a treatment guideline was formulated by the subcommittee for this guideline. When agreement was incomplete regarding the evidence base or treatment guideline, consensus from the committee chair, vice chair, and 2 assigned reviewers determined the outcome. The final grade of recommendation and level of evidence for each statement were determined using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system (Table 1).1,5 Members of the ASCRS Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee worked in joint production of these guidelines from inception to final publication. Recommendations formulated by the subcommittee were then reviewed by the entire Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee for edits and recommendations. Final recommendations were approved by the ASCRS Clinical Guidelines Committee and ASCRS Executive Committee. In general, each ASCRS Clinical Practice Guideline is updated every 3 to 5 years.TABLE 1.: The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation System Grading RecommendationsEVALUATION OF HEMORRHOIDS 1. A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed, emphasizing degree and duration of symptoms and risk factors. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. The diagnosis of hemorrhoids is almost always a clinical one and should start with a medical history, with great care taken to identify symptoms suggestive of hemorrhoidal disease and risk factors such as constipation,6 followed by a focused physical examination. The cardinal signs of internal hemorrhoids are painless bleeding with bowel movements with intermittent protrusion. Focus should be on the extent, severity, and duration of symptoms such as bleeding and prolapse, issues of perineal hygiene, and presence or absence of pain. A careful review of fiber intake and bowel habits, including frequency, consistency, and ease of evacuation, should also be performed, because constipation predisposes patients to hemorrhoidal disease.6,7 A careful assessment of fecal incontinence symptoms should also be made, because this may affect management decisions, to include the possibility of surgical treatment. Physical examination in the prone, knee–chest, or lateral decubitus position should include visual inspection of the anus, as well as digital rectal examination to evaluate for other anal pathology and sphincter integrity. In addition, an evaluation of the patient while straining on the bathroom will assist in the diagnosis of hemorrhoidal prolapse, as well as exclude full-thickness rectal prolapse. An anoscopic examination should be performed to assess the anatomy.8 Internal hemorrhoids, located above the dentate line, can be assigned a grade based on the definitions in Table 2, which may help to guide therapy. Laboratory evaluation is not typically required for diagnostic purposes.TABLE 2.: Classification of Internal HemorrhoidsEVALUATION OF RECTAL BLEEDING 1. Complete endoscopic evaluation of the colon is indicated in select patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Although hemorrhoidal disease is the most common reason for hematochezia, other disease processes, such as colorectal cancer, IBD, other colitides, diverticular disease, and angiodysplasia, can also precipitate bleeding.9 While the majority of patients with hematochezia will not have colorectal cancer, rectal bleeding attributed to hemorrhoids represents the most common missed opportunity to establish a cancer diagnosis.10 Obtaining a thorough personal and family history and a physical examination, which may include proctoscopy and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy, will identify high-risk patients requiring more extensive evaluation. Previous endoscopy records should be reviewed, when available.

In 1991, several laboratories identified a product from a second gene with COX activity and called it COX-2. However, COX-2 was inducible, and the inducing stimuli included pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, implying a role for COX-2 in both inflammation and control of cell growth. The two isoforms of COX are almost identical in structure but have important differences in substrate and inhibitor selectivity and in their intracellular locations. Protective PGs, which preserve the integrity of the stomach lining and maintain normal renal function in a compromised kidney, are synthesized by COX-1. In addition to the induction of COX-2 in inflammatory lesions, it is present constitutively in the brain and spinal cord, where it may be involved in nerve transmission, particularly that for pain and fever. PGs made by COX-2 are also important in ovulation and in the birth process. The discovery of COX-2 has made possible the design of drugs that reduce inflammation without removing the protective PGs in the stomach and kidney made by COX-1. These highly selective COX-2 inhibitors may not only be anti-inflammatory but may also be active in colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

,10.1186/cc12685,Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline,Critical Care,2013.0,"Abstract Introduction Evidence-based recommendations are needed to guide the acute management of the bleeding trauma patient. When these recommendations are implemented patient outcomes may be improved. Methods The multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was formed in 2005 with the aim of developing a guideline for the management of bleeding following severe injury. This document represents an updated version of the guideline published by the group in 2007 and updated in 2010. Recommendations were formulated using a nominal group process, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence and based on a systematic review of published literature. Results Key changes encompassed in this version of the guideline include new recommendations on the appropriate use of vasopressors and inotropic agents, and reflect an awareness of the growing number of patients in the population at large treated with antiplatelet agents and/or oral anticoagulants. The current guideline also includes recommendations and a discussion of thromboprophylactic strategies for all patients following traumatic injury. The most significant addition is a new section that discusses the need for every institution to develop, implement and adhere to an evidence-based clinical protocol to manage traumatically injured patients. The remaining recommendations have been re-evaluated and graded based on literature published since the last edition of the guideline. Consideration was also given to changes in clinical practice that have taken place during this time period as a result of both new evidence and changes in the general availability of relevant agents and technologies. Conclusions A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to trauma care and mechanisms with which to ensure that established protocols are consistently implemented will ensure a uniform and high standard of care across Europe and beyond. http://ccforum.com/content/17/4/442",OpenAlex,0,4,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,hemorrhage,none,11.0

It is associated with numerous comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain cancers, and sleep apnea/sleep-disordered breathing. In fact, obesity is an independent risk factor for CVD, and CVD risks have also been documented in obese children. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality as well as reduced life expectancy. Health service use and medical costs associated with obesity and related diseases have risen dramatically and are expected to continue to rise. Besides an altered metabolic profile, a variety of adaptations/alterations in cardiac structure and function occur in the individual as adipose tissue accumulates in excess amounts, even in the absence of comorbidities. Hence, obesity may affect the heart through its influence on known risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance, inflammatory markers, obstructive sleep apnea/hypoventilation, and the prothrombotic state, in addition to as-yet-unrecognized mechanisms.

Summary Background Data Laparoscopic GBP has been reported to be a safe and effective approach for the treatment of morbid obesity. The authors performed a prospective randomized trial to compare outcomes, QOL, and costs of laparoscopic GBP with those of open GBP. Methods From May 1999 to March 2001, 155 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 to 60 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 79) or open (n = 76) GBP. The two groups were similar in age, sex ratio, mean BMI, and comorbidities. Main outcome measures included operative time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, operative complications, percentage of excess body weight loss, and time to return to activities of daily living and work. Changes in QOL were assessed using the SF-36 Health Survey and the bariatric analysis of reporting outcome system (BAROS). Operative and hospital costs of the two operations were also compared. Results There were no deaths in either group. Mean operative time was longer for laparoscopic GBP than for open GBP, but operative blood loss was less. Two (2.5%) of the 79 patients in the laparoscopic group required conversion to laparotomy. Median length of hospital stay was shorter for laparoscopic GBP patients (3 vs 4 days). The rate of postoperative anastomotic leak was similar between groups. Wound-related complications such as infection (10.5 vs 1.3%) and incisional hernia (7.9 vs 0%) were more common after open GBP; late anastomotic stricture was less frequent after open GBP (2.6 vs 11.4%). Time to return to activities of daily living and work were shorter after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP. Weight loss at 1 year was similar between groups. Preoperative SF-36 scores were similar between groups; however, at 1 month after surgery, laparoscopic patients had better physical conditioning, social functioning, general health, and less body pain than open GBP patients. At 6 months, the BAROS outcome was classified as good or better in 97% of laparoscopic GBP patients compared with 82% of open GBP patients. Operative costs were higher for laparoscopic GBP patients, but hospital costs were lower. Conclusions Laparoscopic GBP is a safe and cost-effective alternative to open GBP. Despite a longer operative time, patients undergoing laparoscopic GBP benefited from less blood loss, a shorter hospital stay, and faster convalescence. Laparoscopic GBP patients had comparable weight loss at 1 year but a more rapid improvement in QOL than open GBP patients. The higher initial operative costs for laparoscopic GBP were adequately offset by the lower hospital costs.",OpenAlex,0,3,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,infection,9.0

A revised, complete, and significantly edited practice management guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in trauma patients is presented herein. The step-by-step process of practice management guideline development, as outlined by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), has been used as the methodology for the development of these guidelines. 2 Briefly, the first step in guideline development is a classification of scientific evidence. A Class I study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. A Class II study is a clinical study with prospectively collected data or large retrospective analyses with reliable data. A Class III study is retrospective data, expert opinion, or a case report. Once the evidence is classified, it can be used to make recommendations. A Level I recommendation is convincingly justifiable on the basis of the scientific information alone. Usually, such a recommendation is made on the basis of a preponderance of Class I data, but some strong Class II data can be used. A Level II recommendation means the recommendation is reasonably justifiable, usually on the basis of a preponderance of Class II data. If there are not enough Class I data to support a Level I recommendation, they may be used to support a Level II recommendation. A Level III recommendation is generally only supported by Class III data. These practice guidelines address eight different areas of practice management as they relate to the prevention and diagnosis of venous thromboembolism in trauma patients. There are few Level I recommendations because there is a paucity of Class I data in the area of trauma literature. We believe it is important to highlight areas where future investigation may bring about definitive Level I recommendations. RISK FACTORS FOR VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM AFTER INJURY I. Statement of the Problem A number of factors have been reported to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after injury. Because VTE prophylaxis is associated with complications, it is essential to identify subgroups of trauma patients in whom the benefit of VTE prophylaxis will outweigh the risk of its administration. This is important because the benefits from the different methods of prophylaxis are still unclear when compared with no prophylaxis. Because the literature is inconsistent, a systematic review is needed to produce the best available evidence. Below, we describe the results of a meta-analysis of the existing literature. The reader needs to remember the limitations of meta-analysis. In addition, the fact that a risk factor was not identified as significant in meta-analysis does not mean that this factor must be ignored. Absence of proof does not equal proof of absence. It only means that enough evidence does not exist and that further studies of high quality are needed. II. Process Three literature databases were searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register) for articles reporting risk factors of VTE. All articles were reviewed by two independent reviewers and a third reviewer in cases of disagreement. The review was prepared against predetermined screening criteria, and the articles were given a numerical quality score. From an initial broad research that identified 4,093 relevant titles, 73 articles met all the inclusion criteria and were finally accepted for meta-analysis. Pooled effect sizes (odds ratio [OR] and their 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were estimated by the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. Shrinkage graphs were produced to display the effect size of each study and to compare with the overall model estimate. The heterogeneity among studies was tested by the Q statistic and p value for the χ2 test of heterogeneity. A level of significance at p < 0.05 was used for all comparisons. To include a risk factor for meta-analysis, three or more studies reported on the risk factor. Risk factors identified only in one or two studies were not included. The risk factors identified were treated as either dichotomous or continuous variables as appropriate. For instance, if three or more studies provided data on the incidence of VTE in patients who were older or younger than 55 years old, then the risk factor was ""age > 55,"" a dichotomous variable. On the other hand, if three or more studies provided data on the age of patients with or without VTE by using only a mean and SD, the risk factor was simply ""age,"" a continuous variable (Table 1).Table 1: Studies Reporting on Risk Factors of Venous Thromboembolism in Trauma PatientsIII. Recommendations Level I: Patients with spinal cord injuries or spinal fractures are at high-risk for venous thromboembolism after trauma. 2–12 Level II: 1. Older age is an increased factor for venous thromboembolism, but it is not clear at what exact age the risk increases substantially. 4,5,9,11,13,14 2. Increasing Injury Severity Score (ISS) and blood transfusion appear to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, but this association is still unclear. 3,5,8,9,14,15 3. Traditional risk factors such as long bone fractures, 3–6,9–13,15–17 pelvic fractures, 3–5,9–12,15,18 or head injuries, 3–9,15 although significantly associated with a high risk of venous thromboembolisms in single-institution studies, were not found to be powerful risk factors on meta-analysis. IV. Scientific Foundation Risk factors As Dichotomous Variables The following variables were reported in three or more studies and were included in the meta-analysis: gender, 3,13,18,19 head injury, 3–9,15 long bone fracture, 3–6,9–13,16,17,19 pelvic fracture, 3–5,9–12,15 spinal fracture, 3–12 and spinal cord injury. 4,9–12 A number of studies included age as a risk factor, but the different cut-off points used in each study (age > 30, 40, 50, 55, etc.) did not allow an analysis of this variable. The only risk factors found to place the patient at higher risk for development of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were spinal fractures (OR, 2.260; 95%; CI, 1.415–3.610) and, even greater, spinal cord injury (OR, 3.017; 95%",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,8.0
,10.1086/525258,Treatment of Aspergillosis: Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Clinical Infectious Diseases,2008.0,"Aspergillus species have emerged as an important cause of life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. This expanding population is composed of patients with prolonged neutropenia, advanced HIV infection, and inherited immunodeficiency and patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and/or lung transplantation. This document constitutes the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America for treatment of aspergillosis and replaces the practice guidelines for Aspergillus published in 2000 [1]. The objective of these guidelines is to summarize the current evidence for treatment of different forms of aspergillosis. The quality of evidence for treatment is scored according to a standard system used in other Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. This document reviews guidelines for management of the 3 major forms of aspergillosis: invasive aspergillosis, chronic (and saprophytic) forms of aspergillosis, and allergic forms of aspergillosis. Given the public health importance of invasive aspergillosis, emphasis is placed on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the different forms of invasive aspergillosis, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, sinus aspergillosis, disseminated aspergillosis, and several types of single-organ invasive aspergillosis. There are few randomized trials on the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. The largest randomized controlled trial demonstrates that voriconazole is superior to deoxycholate amphotericin B (D-AMB) as primary treatment for invasive aspergillosis. Voriconazole is recommended for the primary treatment of invasive aspergillosis in most patients (A-I). Although invasive pulmonary aspergillosis accounts for the preponderance of cases treated with voriconazole, voriconazole has been used in enough cases of extrapulmonary and disseminated infection to allow one to infer that voriconazole is effective in these cases. A randomized trial comparing 2 doses of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) showed similar efficacy in both arms, suggesting that liposomal therapy could be considered as alternative primary therapy in some patients (A-I). For salvage therapy, agents include lipid formulations of amphotericin (LFAB; A-II), posaconazole (B-II), itraconazole (B-II), caspofungin (B-II), or micafungin (B-II). Salvage therapy for invasive aspergillosis poses important challenges with significant gaps in knowledge. In patients whose aspergillosis is refractory to voriconazole, a paucity of data exist to guide management. Therapeutic options include a change of class using an amphotericin B (AMB) formulation or an echinocandin, such as caspofungin (B-II); further use of azoles should take into account host factors and pharmacokinetic considerations. Refractory infection may respond to a change to another drug class (B-II) or to a combination of agents (B-II). The role of combination therapy in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis as primary or salvage therapy is uncertain and warrants a prospective, controlled clinical trial. Assessment of patients with refractory aspergillosis may be difficult. In evaluating such patients, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis should be established if it was previously uncertain and should be confirmed if it was previously known. The drug dosage should be considered. Management options include a change to intravenous (IV) therapy, therapeutic monitoring of drug levels, change of drug class, and/or combination therapy. Antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole can be recommended in the subgroup of HSCT recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis and in neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis (A-I). Management of breakthrough invasive aspergillosis in the context of mould-active azole prophylaxis is not defined by clinical trial data. The approach to such patients should be individualized on the basis of clinical criteria, including host immunosuppression, underlying disease, and site of infection, as well as consideration of antifungal dosing, therapeutic monitoring of drug levels, a switch to IV therapy, and/or a switch to another drug class (B-III). Certain conditions of invasive aspergillosis warrant consideration for surgical resection of the infected focus. These include but are not limited to pulmonary lesions contiguous with the heart or great vessels, invasion of the chest wall, osteomyelitis, pericardial infection, and endocarditis (B-III). Restoration of impaired host defenses is critical for improved outcome of invasive aspergillosis (A-III). Recovery from neutropenia in a persistently neutropenic host or reduction of corticosteroids in a patient receiving high-dose glucocorticosteroids is paramount for improved outcome in invasive aspergillosis. A special consideration is made concerning recommendations for therapy of aspergillosis in uncommon sites, such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis. There are very limited data on these infections, and most involve D-AMB as primary therapy simply because of its long-standing availability. Based on the strength of the randomized study, the panel recommends voriconazole for primary treatment of these very uncommon manifestations of invasive aspergillosis (B-III). Management of the chronic or saprophytic forms of aspergillosis varies depending on the condition. Single pulmonary aspergillomas may be best managed by surgical resection (B-III), whereas chronic cavitary and chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis require long-term medical therapy (B-III). The management of allergic forms of aspergillosis involves a combination of medical and anti-inflammatory therapy.

Hemorrhagic shock can be rapidly fatal. The primary goals are to stop the bleeding and to restore circulating blood volume. Resuscitation may well depend on the estimated severity of hemorrhage. It now appears that patients with moderate hypotension from bleeding may benefit by delaying massive fluid resuscitation until they reach a definitive care facility. On the other hand, the use of intravenous fluids, crystalloids or colloids, and blood products can be life saving in those patients who are in severe hemorrhagic shock. The optimal method of resuscitation has not been clearly established. A hemoglobin level of 7–8 g/dl appears to be an appropriate threshold for transfusion in critically ill patients with no evidence of tissue hypoxia. However, maintaining a higher hemoglobin level of 10 g/dl is a reasonable goal in actively bleeding patients, the elderly, or individuals who are at risk for myocardial infarction. Moreover, hemoglobin concentration should not be the only therapeutic guide in actively bleeding patients. Instead, therapy should be aimed at restoring intravascular volume and adequate hemodynamic parameters.",OpenAlex,0,5,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,10.5

The deaths were initially reviewed at a weekly Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conference followed by a multidisciplinary (Trauma Surgery, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Neurosurgery, Nursing, and Coroner) Combined Trauma Death Review Committee, and were classified into nonpreventable, potentially preventable, and preventable deaths. All preventable and potentially preventable deaths were identified for the purpose of the study. Quality improvement death forms included data on epidemiology, vital signs, injury severity, type of injury, probability of survival with Trauma and Injury Severity Score methodology, preventability (nonpreventable, potentially preventable, and preventable deaths), errors in the evaluation and management of the patient, and classification of errors (system, judgment, knowledge). Additional injury details, clinical course, circumstances leading to the death and autopsy findings were abstracted from the trauma registry and individual chart review.During the study period, 35,311 patients meeting trauma registry criteria were admitted and a total of 2,081 (5.9%) deaths occurred. Fifty-one deaths were classified as preventable or potentially preventable deaths (0.1% of admissions, 2.5% of deaths). Eleven of them (0.53% of deaths) were classified as preventable and 40 (1.92% of deaths) as potentially preventable deaths. Mean age was 40 years, 66.7% were men, mean Injury Severity Score was 27, 74.5% were blunt. The most common cause of death was bleeding (20, 39.2%) followed by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (14, 27.5%) and cardiorespiratory arrest (8, 15.6%). This was caused by a delay in treatment (27, 52.9%), clinical judgment error (11, 21.6%), missed diagnosis (6, 11.8%), technical error (4, 7.8%), and other (3, 5.9%). The deaths peaked at two time periods: 26 (51.1%) during the first 24 hours and 16 (31.4%) after 7 days. Only one patient (2.0%) died in the first hour. The most common location of death was the intensive care unit (28, 54.9%), operating room (13, 25.5%), and emergency room (5, 9.8%).Preventable or potentially preventable deaths are rare but do occur at an academic Level I trauma center.

Alimentary track mucositis increases mortality and morbidity and contributes to rising health care costs. Consequently, the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society for Oral Oncology assembled an expert panel to evaluate the literature and to create evidence-based guidelines for preventing, evaluating, and treating mucositis. METHODS Thirty-six panelists reviewed literature published between January 1966 and May 2002. An initial meeting in January 2002 produced a preliminary draft of guidelines that was reviewed at a second meeting the same year. Thereafter, a writing committee produced a report on mucositis pathogenesis, epidemiology, and scoring (also included in this issue), as well as clinical practice guidelines. RESULTS Panelists created recommendations from higher levels of evidence and suggestions when evidence was of a lower level and there was a consensus regarding the interpretation of the evidence by the panel. Panelists identified gaps in evidence that made it impossible to recommend or not recommend use of specific agents. CONCLUSIONS Oral/GI mucositis is a common side effect of many anticancer therapies. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are presented as a benchmark for clinicians to use for routine care of appropriate patients and as a springboard to challenge clinical investigators to conduct high-quality trials geared toward areas in which data are either lacking or conflicting.

Hemorrhoids are defined as the symptomatic enlargement and distal displacement of the normal anal cushions. The most common symptom of hemorrhoids is rectal bleeding associated with bowel movement. The abnormal dilatation and distortion of the vascular channel, together with destructive changes in the supporting connective tissue within the anal cushion, is a paramount finding of hemorrhoids. It appears that the dysregulation of the vascular tone and vascular hyperplasia might play an important role in hemorrhoidal development, and could be a potential target for medical treatment. In most instances, hemorrhoids are treated conservatively, using many methods such as lifestyle modification, fiber supplement, suppository-delivered anti-inflammatory drugs, and administration of venotonic drugs. Non-operative approaches include sclerotherapy and, preferably, rubber band ligation. An operation is indicated when non-operative approaches have failed or complications have occurred. Several surgical approaches for treating hemorrhoids have been introduced including hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy, but postoperative pain is invariable. Some of the surgical treatments potentially cause appreciable morbidity such as anal stricture and incontinence.

Further reductions in pump size, centrifugal design, and intrapericardial positioning may reduce complications and improve outcomes.We studied a small, intrapericardially positioned, continuous-flow centrifugal pump in patients requiring an implanted ventricular assist device as a bridge to heart transplantation. The course of investigational pump recipients was compared with that of patients implanted contemporaneously with commercially available devices. The primary outcome, success, was defined as survival on the originally implanted device, transplantation, or explantation for ventricular recovery at 180 days and was evaluated for both noninferiority and superiority. Secondary outcomes included a comparison of survival between groups and functional and quality-of-life outcomes and adverse events in the investigational device group. A total of 140 patients received the investigational pump, and 499 patients received a commercially available pump implanted contemporaneously. Success occurred in 90.7% of investigational pump patients and 90.1% of controls, establishing the noninferiority of the investigational pump (P<0.001; 15% noninferiority margin). At 6 months, median 6-minute walk distance improved by 128.5 m, and both disease-specific and global quality-of-life scores improved significantly.A small, intrapericardially positioned, continuous-flow, centrifugal pump was noninferior to contemporaneously implanted, commercially available ventricular assist devices.

Indices of shock such as base deficit, serum lactate level, and admission hemodynamic status (systolic blood pressure, heart rate) and admission hematocrit were considered potential confounding variables in that study. The objectives of this study were to evaluate admission anemia and blood transfusion within the first 24 hours as independent predictors of mortality, ICU admission, ICU length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS, with serum lactate level, base deficit, and shock index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure) as covariates. Methods Prospective data were collected on 15,534 patients admitted to a Level I trauma center over a 3-year period (1998–2000) and stratified by age, gender, race, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and Injury Severity Score. Admission anemia and blood transfusion were assessed as independent predictors of mortality, ICU admission, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS by logistic regression analysis, with base deficit, serum lactate, and shock index as covariates. Results Blood transfusion was a strong independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82–4.40;p < 0.001), ICU admission (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.69–3.99;p < 0.001), ICU LOS (p < 0.001), and hospital LOS (Coef, 4.37; 95% CI, 2.79–5.94;p < 0.001) when stratified by indices of shock (base deficit, serum lactate, shock index, and anemia). Patients who underwent blood transfusion were almost three times more likely to die and greater than three times more likely to be admitted to the ICU. Admission anemia (hematocrit < 36%) was an independent predictor of ICU admission (p = 0.008), ICU LOS (p = 0.012), and hospital LOS (p < 0.001). Conclusion Blood transfusion is confirmed as an independent predictor of mortality, ICU admission, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS in trauma after controlling for severity of shock by admission base deficit, lactate, shock index, and anemia.

Materials and Methods: Between February 1, 1998 and May 1, 1999, 120 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Morbidity of the first 40 (group 1), next 40 (group 2) and last 40 (group 3) procedures was compared. Oncological data were assessed by pathological examination and postoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA). Functional results were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire for the first 60 patients and potency was assessed in the last 40. Results: Mean operating time plus or minus standard deviation was 239 ± 59 minutes (range 150 to 450) for the series, and 282, 247 and 231, respectively, for groups 1, 2 and 3. Surgical conversion was necessary in 7 cases (5.8%) overall, including 10% (4) in group 1, 7.5% (3) in group 2 and 0% in group 3. Mean intraoperative bleeding was 402 ± 293 ml. (range 50 to 1,500) in the series, and 534, 517 and 277, respectively, for groups 1, 2 and 3. The transfusion rate was 10% overall, and 15%, 12.5% and 2.5%, respectively, in groups 1, 2 and 3. The reoperation rate was 1.7%. Mean postoperative bladder catheterization time was 6.6 ± 2.4 days. The positive and questionable surgical margin rate was 15%. Pathological tumor stage was pT2a in 4 specimens (11%), pT2b in 11 (16%), pT3a in 0 and pT3b in 3 (50%) with positive surgical margins. PSA assays were available in 94 patients with a mean postoperative followup of 2.2 months (range 1 to 12). Serum PSA was 0.1 ng./ml. or less in 89 men (94.7%). The continence rate at 6 months postoperatively was 72% among the first 60 patients. Of 20 group 3 patients who were sexually active preoperatively 9 (45%) reported postoperative spontaneous erections. The overall cost of retropubic radical prostatectomy was about $1,237 more than that for laparoscopy. Conclusions: Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is feasible and perioperative morbidity is low. Based on our postoperative followup, oncological results are identical to those of conventional surgery and functional results are encouraging. References 1 : Cholecystectomy by coelioscopy.

In 2001, the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) published practice management guidelines for the management of hemorrhage in pelvic trauma. Since that time there have been new practice patterns and larger experiences with older techniques. The Practice Guidelines Committee of EAST decided to replace the 2001 guidelines with an updated guideline and systematic review reflecting current practice. Methods: Building on the previous systematic literature review in the 2001 EAST guidelines, a systematic literature review was performed to include references from 1999 to 2010. Prospective and retrospective studies were included. Reviews and case reports were excluded. Of the 1,432 articles identified, 50 were selected as meeting criteria. Nine Trauma Surgeons, an Interventional Radiologist, and an Orthopedic Surgeon reviewed the articles. The EAST primer was used to grade the evidence. Results: Six questions regarding hemorrhage from pelvic fracture were addressed: (1) Which patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures warrant early external mechanical stabilization? (2) Which patients require emergent angiography? (3) What is the best test to exclude extrapelvic bleeding? (4) Are there radiologic findings which predict hemorrhage? (5) What is the role of noninvasive temporary external fixation devices? and (6) Which patients warrant preperitoneal packing? Conclusions: Hemorrhage due to pelvic fracture remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the trauma patient. Strong recommendations were made regarding questions 1 to 4. Further study is needed to answer questions 5 and 6.",OpenAlex,0,7,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,hemorrhage,none,15.5

De Paola, MD, PhD; Peter M. Kistler, MBBS, PhD; Gregory Y.H. Lip, MD; Nicholas S. Peters, MD; Cristiano F. Pisani, MD; Antonio Raviele, MD; Eduardo B. Saad, MD, PhD; Kazuhiro Satomi, MD, PhD; Martin K. Stiles, MB ChB, PhD; Stephan Willems, MD, PhD During the past three decades, catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) have evolved from investigational procedures to their current role as effective treatment options for patients with AF. Surgical ablation of AF, using either standard, minimally invasive, or hybrid techniques, is available in most major hospitals throughout the world. Catheter ablation of AF is even more widely available, and is now the most commonly performed catheter ablation procedure. In 2007, an initial Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical AF Ablation was developed as a joint effort of the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), and the European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society (ECAS).1 The 2007 document was also developed in collaboration with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC). This Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical AF Ablation was rewritten in 2012 to reflect the many advances in AF ablation that had occurred in the interim.2 The rate of advancement in the tools, techniques, and outcomes of AF ablation continue to increase as enormous research efforts are focused on the mechanisms, outcomes, and treatment of AF. For this reason, the HRS initiated an effort to rewrite and update this Consensus Statement. Reflecting both the worldwide importance of AF, as well as the worldwide performance of AF ablation, this document is the result of a joint partnership between the HRS, EHRA, ECAS, the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), and the Latin American Society of Cardiac Stimulation and Electrophysiology (Sociedad Latinoamericana de Estimulación Cardíaca y Electrofisiología [SOLAECE]). The purpose of this 2017 Consensus Statement is to provide a state-of-the-art review of the field of catheter and surgical ablation of AF and to report the findings of a writing group, convened by these five international societies. The writing group is charged with defining the indications, techniques, and outcomes of AF ablation procedures. Included within this document are recommendations pertinent to the design of clinical trials in the field of AF ablation and the reporting of outcomes, including definitions relevant to this topic. The writing group is composed of 60 experts representing 11 organizations: HRS, EHRA, ECAS, APHRS, SOLAECE, STS, ACC, American Heart Association (AHA), Canadian Heart Rhythm Society (CHRS), Japanese Heart Rhythm Society (JHRS), and Brazilian Society of Cardiac Arrhythmias (Sociedade Brasileira de Arritmias Cardíacas [SOBRAC]). All the members of the writing group, as well as peer reviewers of the document, have provided disclosure statements for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential conflicts of interest. All author and peer reviewer disclosure information is provided in Table A1 and Table B1. In writing a consensus document, it is recognized that consensus does not mean that there was complete agreement among all the writing group members. Surveys of the entire writing group were used to identify areas of consensus concerning performance of AF ablation procedures and to develop recommendations concerning the indications for catheter and surgical AF ablation. These recommendations were systematically balloted by the 60 writing group members and were approved by a minimum of 80% of these members. The recommendations were also subject to a 1-month public comment period. Each partnering and collaborating organization then officially reviewed, commented on, edited, and endorsed the final document and recommendations. The grading system for indication of class of evidence level was adapted based on that used by the ACC and the AHA.3, 4 It is important to state, however, that this document is not a guideline. The indications for catheter and surgical ablation of AF, as well as recommendations for procedure performance, are presented with a Class and Level of Evidence (LOE) to be consistent with what the reader is familiar with seeing in guideline statements. A Class I recommendation means that the benefits of the AF ablation procedure markedly exceed the risks, and that AF ablation should be performed; a Class IIa recommendation means that the benefits of an AF ablation procedure exceed the risks, and that it is reasonable to perform AF ablation; a Class IIb recommendation means that the benefit of AF ablation is greater or equal to the risks, and that AF ablation may be considered; and a Class III recommendation means that AF ablation is of no proven benefit and is not recommended. The writing group reviewed and ranked evidence supporting current recommendations with the weight of evidence ranked as Level A if the data were derived from high-quality evidence from more than one randomized clinical trial, meta-analyses of high-quality randomized clinical trials, or one or more randomized clinical trials corroborated by high-quality registry studies. The writing group ranked available evidence as Level B-R when there was moderate-quality evidence from one or more randomized clinical trials, or meta-analyses of moderate-quality randomized clinical trials. Level B-NR was used to denote moderate-quality evidence from one or more well-designed, well-executed nonrandomized studies, observational studies, or registry studies. This designation was also used to denote moderate-quality evidence from meta-analyses of such studies. Evidence was ranked as Level C-LD when the primary source of the recommendation was randomized or nonrandomized observational or registry studies with limitations of design or execution, meta-analyses of such studies, or physiological or mechanistic studies of human subjects. Level C-EO was defined as expert opinion based on the clinical experience of the writing group. Despite a large number of authors, the participation of several societies and professional organizations, and the attempts of the group to reflect the current knowledge in the field adequately, this document is not intended as a guideline. Rather, the group would like to refer to the current guidelines on AF management for the purpose of guiding overall AF management strategies.5, 6 This consensus document is specifically focused on catheter and surgical ablation",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,4.0

Despite this multidisciplinary approach, our recent analysis confirms an alarming 40% mortality in these high-risk patients. Therefore, we pursued alternate therapies to improve patient outcomes. European trauma groups have suggested the technique of pelvic packing via laparotomy to directly address the venous bleeding that comprises 85% of pelvic fracture hemorrhage. We hypothesized that a modified technique of direct preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP) would reduce the need for angiography, decrease blood transfusion requirements, and lower mortality. Methods: Since September 2004, all patients at our ACS-verified level I trauma center with hemodynamic instability and pelvic fractures underwent PPP/external fixation, according to our protocol. Statistics are reported as mean ± SEM and analyzed using Student's t test. Results: During the study period, 28 consecutive patients underwent PPP. There was one protocol deviation of prePPP angiography to evaluate an extremity vascular injury. The majority were men (68%) with a mean age of 40 ± 3.9 years and a mean injury severity score of 55 ± 3.0. The mean emergency department (ED) systolic blood pressure was 77 ± 3.0 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 ± 4.3 bpm, and base deficit 13 ± 0.8 mmol/L. Pelvic fracture classifications included lateral compression (LC) II (9), anteroposterior compression (APC) III (8), LC I (3), vertical shear (3), LC III (3), and APC II (2). Patients required 4 ± 1.2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during 82 ± 13 minutes in the ED. Blood transfusion requirements before postoperative surgical intensive care unit (SICU) admission compared with the subsequent 24 postoperative hours were significantly different (12 ± 2.0 versus 6 ± 1.1; p = 0.006). The first 4 patients underwent routine angiography postPPP, with 1 undergoing therapeutic embolization; 4 of the subsequent 24 patients underwent angioembolization with clinical concern of ongoing pelvic hemorrhage. Seven (25%) patients died from multiple organ failure (2), postinjury myocardial infarction/pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest (2), invasive mucormycosis (1), withdrawal of care (1), and closed head injury (1); there were no deaths as a result of acute blood loss. Conclusions: PPP is a rapid method for controlling pelvic fracture-related hemorrhage that can supplant the need for emergent angiography. There is a significant reduction in blood product transfusion after PPP, and this approach appears to reduce mortality in this select high-risk group of patients.",OpenAlex,0,5,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,10.5

Recently secondary (2°) ACS has been reported in patients without abdominal injury who require aggressive resuscitation. The purpose of this study was to compare the epidemiology of 1° and 2° ACS and develop early prediction models in a high-risk cohort who were treated in a similar fashion. Methods Major torso trauma patients underwent standardized resuscitation and had prospective data collected including occurrence of ACS, demographics, ISS, urinary bladder pressure, gastric tonometry (GAPCO2 = gastric regional CO2 minus end tidal CO2), laboratory, respiratory, and hemodynamic data. With 1° and 2° ACS as endpoints, variables were tested by uni- and multivariate logistic analysis (MLA). Results From 188 study patients during the 44-month period, 26 (14%) developed ACS—11 (6%) were 1° ACS and 15 (8%) 2° ACS. 1° and 2° ACS had similar demographics, shock, and injury severity. Significant univariate differences included: time to decompression from ICU admit (600 ± 112 vs. 360 ± 48 min), Emergency Department (ED) crystalloid (4 ± 1 vs. 7 ± 1 L), preICU crystalloid (8 ± 1 vs. 12 ± 1L), ED blood administration (2 ± 1 vs. 6 ± 1 U), GAPCO2 (24 ± 3 vs. 36 ± 3 mmHg), requiring pelvic embolization (9 vs. 47%), and emergency operation (82% vs. 40%). Early predictors identified by MLA of 1° ACS included hemoglobin concentration, GAPCO2, temperature, and base deficit; and for 2° ACS they included crystalloid, urinary output, and GAPCO2. The areas under the receiver-operator characteristic curves calculated upon ICU admission are 1° = 0.977 and 2° = 0.983. 1° and 2° ACS patients had similar poor outcomes compared with nonACS patients including ventilator days (1° = 13 ± 3 vs. 2° = 14 ± 3 vs. nonACS = 8 ± 2), multiple organ failure (55% vs. 53% vs. 12%), and mortality (64% vs. 53% vs. 17%). Conclusion 1° and 2° ACS have similar demographics, injury severity, time to decompression from hospital admit, and bad outcome. 2° ACS is an earlier ICU event preceded by more crystalloid administration.

The infection progresses rapidly, and septic shock may ensue; hence, the mortality rate is high (median mortality 32.2%). Prognosis becomes poorer in the presence of co-morbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, chronic alcohol disease, chronic renal failure and liver cirrhosis. Necrotizing fasciitis is classified into four types, depending on microbiological findings. Most cases are polymicrobial, classed as type I. The clinical status of the patient varies from erythema, swelling and tenderness in the early stage to skin ischemia with blisters and bullae in the advanced stage of infection. In its fulminant form, the patient is critically ill with signs and symptoms of severe septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction. The clinical condition is the most important clue for diagnosis. However, in equivocal cases, the diagnosis and severity of the infection can be secured with laboratory-based scoring systems, such as the LRINEC score or FGSI score, especially in regard to Fournier's gangrene. Computed tomography or ultrasonography can be helpful, but definitive diagnosis is attained by exploratory surgery at the infected sites. Management of the infection begins with broad spectrum antibiotics, but early and aggressive drainage and meticulous debridement constitute the mainstay of treatment. Postoperative management of the surgical wound is also important for the patient's survival, along with proper nutrition. The vacuum-assisted closure system has proved to be helpful in wound management, with its combined benefits of continuous cleansing of the wound and the formation of granulation tissue.",OpenAlex,0,0,5,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,7.5

Although the latter is more frequently involved when bleeding occurs in the acute form, a poorer prognosis is to be expected. Abscess, severe inflammation, regional necrosis, and pseudocysts may cause major vessel erosion, with or without pseudoaneurysm formation, whose eventual rupture may result in massive bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, retroperitoneum, and peritoneal cavity. Aims To define the most important pathophysiologic mechanisms and factors that might contribute to a better understanding, better prevention, and more efficient treatment of severe hemorrhage complicating acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Awareness of high-risk conditions occurring during the natural evolution of the disease (from extensive local severe enzymatic damage to late septic sequelae), avoidance of a too early and too aggressive approach to sterile pancreatic necrosis, and providing prompt and effective treatment of local septic complications, when they occur, are crucial steps for bleeding prevention. Methodology Forty-four cases of severe bleeding following acute pancreatitis that were reported during the last decade since 1992 (including the six cases reported here) are reviewed, analyzed, and summarized. Results The overall mortality rate was 34.1%. Splenic artery, portal vein, spleen, and unspecified peripancreatic vessels were the most commonly involved sources of bleeding, with associated mortality rates of 33.3%, 50.0%, 30%, and 28.5%, respectively. Massive hemorrhage was more frequently associated with severe necrosis, with a mortality rate of 37.9%. Conclusion The increased use of diagnostic and interventional radiology, in association with prompt surgical treatment, appears to be the way to improve survival rates in cases of arterial bleeding. Venous bleeding due to lesion of major peripancreatic veins or diffuse bleeding represents a therapeutic challenge, and treatment of these conditions should be tailored to the individual case, as no general rule can be suggested. In extreme cases, open packing or salvage emergency pancreatectomy may represent the only chances for survival.",OpenAlex,0,12,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,18.0

The inhibition of collagen-induced aggregation was significantly correlated with both increased bleeding time and blood urea nitrogen.

The specific pathophysiologic mechanisms are becoming better understood and may have a role in the future management and prevention of long-term consequences, such as esophageal strictures. Whereas the mainstay of diagnosis is considered upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, computed tomography and ultrasound are gaining a more significant role, especially in addressing the need for emergency surgery, whose morbidity and mortality remains high even in the best hands. The need to perform emergency surgery has a persistent long-term negative impact both on survival and functional outcome. Medical or endoscopic prevention of stricture is debatable, yet esophageal stents, absorbable or not, show promising data. Dilatation is the first therapeutic option for strictures and bougies should be considered especially for long, multiple and tortuous narrowing. It is crucial to avoid malnutrition, especially in developing countries where management strategies are influenced by malnutrition and poor clinical conditions.

Intravenous urography is used primarily for gross assessment of renal function in hemodynamically unstable patients. Selective renal arteriography or venography can provide detailed information regarding vascular injury. Retrograde pyelography is valuable in assessing ureteral and renal pelvic integrity in suspected ureteropelvic junction injury. Ultrasonography is useful in detecting hemoperitoneum in patients with suspected intraperitoneal injury but has limited value in evaluating those with suspected extraperitoneal injury. Occasionally, radionuclide renal scintigraphy or magnetic resonance imaging may prove helpful. Renal injuries can be classified into four large categories based on imaging findings. Category I renal injuries include minor cortical contusion, subcapsular hematoma, minor laceration with limited perinephric hematoma, and small cortical infarct. Category II lesions include major renal lacerations extending to the medulla with or without involvement of the collecting system and segmental renal infarct. Category III lesions are catastrophic renal injuries and include multiple renal lacerations and vascular injury involving the renal pedicle. Category IV injuries are ureteropelvic junction injuries.

The EDS comprise a heterogeneous group of connective tissue diseases sharing clinical manifestations in skin, ligaments and joints, blood vessels and internal organs. Most EDS subtypes are caused by mutations in genes encoding the fibrillar collagens type I, III and V, or in genes coding for enzymes involved in the post‐translational modification of these collagens. Easy bruising is, to a variable degree, present in all subtypes of EDS, and is because of fragility of the capillaries and the perivascular connective tissues. Vascular fragility affecting medium‐sized and large arteries and veins is typically observed in the vascular subtype of EDS, caused by a molecular defect in collagen type III, an important constituent of blood vessel walls and hollow organs. Extensive bruising, spontaneous arterial rupture, leading to severe internal bleeding or premature death, and rupture of hollow organs, such as the intestine or the gravid uterus are predominant features of this subtype. Haematological studies including evaluation of clotting factors, platelet aggregation and bleeding time are usually normal in patients with EDS, except for the Hess test (Rumple–Leede test), which may be abnormal, indicating capillary fragility.

Methods: Of 2,064 patients treated for PF, 13 underwent IABO during initial resuscitation to control massive pelvic bleeding leading to CUHS. Our IABO procedure consists of internal aortic occlusion without fluoroscopy, using a latex balloon inflated in the infrarenal aorta. Retrospectively collected data included demographics, fracture classification, additional injuries, blood transfusions, surgical interventions, angiographic procedure, physiologic parameters, and survival. Results: All balloons were successfully placed, and a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (70 mm Hg, p = 0.001) was observed immediately after IABO. Twelve of 13 patients became transferrable. Angiography performed after IABO was positive for arterial injury in 92% of patients, and 9 patients benefitted from arterial embolization. Survival rate was 46% (6 of 13) and was inversely related to the length of inflation (p = 0.026) and the mean Injury Severity Score (p = 0.011).

Because critical care nurses will be directly involved with the administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) to patients with severe sepsis, knowledge of the preparation, infusion, and monitoring of the drug, presented in this article, is essential.Sepsis is a complex process that continues to pose a challenge in critical care. Despite advances in the management of infectious disease, the inability to successfully treat sepsis remains an unsolved clinical problem. Sepsis with acute organ dysfunction (severe sepsis) is common, often fatal, and expensive to treat. Each year, approximately 215000 deaths are due to severe sepsis.1 This number is virtually identical to the number of persons in the United States who die suddenly of coronary heart disease without being hospitalized and exceeds the number of deaths due to breast cancer by a factor of 4.2The increase in the incidence of severe sepsis is expected to exceed the growth of the US population well into the middle of this century. As discussed in the following, several factors contribute to this increase.3 Severe sepsis is associated with a mortality rate of 28% to 50%, percentages that are unacceptable when advances in the understanding of infectious disease and the patho-physiology of severe sepsis are considered. Additionally, the cost of treating patients with severe sepsis is estimated to be more than $16 billion per year.1Treatment with drotrecogin alfa (activated), trade name Xigris, was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reduction of mortality in adult patients with severe sepsis who have a high risk of death (eg, as determined by scores on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II). Critical care nurses should be familiar with this novel therapy in order to facilitate its transition into critical care practice. In this article, information is provided on the pathophysiological changes associated with severe sepsis, the use of drotrecogin alfa (activated) for patients with severe sepsis, and issues related to nursing care for patients with severe sepsis who are receiving this new therapy.In the United States, severe sepsis is the most common cause of death in noncardiac intensive care units and is the 10th leading cause of death overall.4,5 Recent data1 from an observational cohort study of all nonfederal hospitals in 7 states indicate that more than 750000 cases of severe sepsis occur each year in the United States. This number translates into an incidence of 3.0 cases per 1000 population and 2.26 cases per 100 hospital discharges.1 The incidence of sepsis is increasing because of several factors (Table 1). An important issue in estimating the number of cases of sepsis is that until recently, no diagnostic classification code existed for sepsis, only for septicemia. Because only approximately 30% of all patients with sepsis have blood cultures positive for microorganisms, cases classified as septicemia do not accurately reflect the true numbers of patients who have sepsis.6 The creation of diagnostic classification codes for severe sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) will enhance recognition of the diseases and lead to a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of sepsis.The diagnosis of sepsis is based on a variety of clinical and physiological signs and symptoms in addition to the results of diagnostic and laboratory tests. Changes in vital signs may be the first indication of an infectious process, with elevated body temperature and increased heart rate or respiratory rate occurring as subtle but key indicators of potential sepsis. Other clinical signs, including decreased skin perfusion, decreased urine output, and central nervous system alterations (eg, confusion, agitation, lethargy), may also be present. Suspicious wound drainage, redness or swelling at the insertion sites of catheters, and cloudy or foul-smelling urine may also be clinical evidence of a possible infection. Results of diagnostic and laboratory tests, including abnormal findings on chest radiographs, elevated white blood cell count, and cultures positive for microorganisms, can provide evidence of infection. Cultures of blood, sputum, urine, or wound material may not indicate a causative organism. For 20% to 30% of patients with sepsis, a definite site of infection is not determined.6Detection of clinical indications of infection and timely initiation of diagnostic tests are important components in the early diagnosis of sepsis. The role of critical care nurses in detecting sepsis is important, because astute observation and assessment of patients can result in early and prompt diagnosis and treatment, with a subsequent decrease in sepsis-related mortality.To assist clinicians and researchers, the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Committee agreed on a set of definitions that can be applied to patients with sepsis and its sequelae7,8 (Table 2). The purpose of providing the definitions was to create a universal language to facilitate communication about and diagnosis of sepsis and organ failure, because terms related to sepsis were being used interchangeably.Sepsis is defined as SIRS caused by infection and is distinguished from other conditions, such as pancreatitis, that may result in SIRS. Recognizing that sepsis and its sequelae are a heterogeneous group of disorders with variable clinical and pathophysiological severities, the consensus committee defined severe sepsis as sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension.Although these criteria have provided a framework for communication and investigation of sepsis and its sequelae, they have been criticized as being overly sensitive and not specific.9 In addition, they do not address the basic pathophysiology of the process. Consequently, a committee of representatives of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the American College of Chest Physicians met in late 2001 to reevaluate and update the criteria. As a result, an expanded list of signs and symptoms (Table 3) was created to facilitate recognition of sepsis.10Severe sepsis is associated with 3 integrated responses: activation of inflammation, activation of coagulation, and impairment of fibrinolysis. These 3 responses are due to a variety of proinflammatory mediators, procoagulant factors, and inhibitors of fibrinolysis.

The clinical spectrum varies from mild skin and joint hyperlaxity to severe physical disability and life-threatening vascular complications. The current Villefranche classification recognizes six subtypes, most of which are linked to mutations in genes encoding fibrillar collagens or enzymes involved in post-translational modification of these proteins. Mutations in type V and type III collagen cause classic or vascular EDS respectively, while mutations involving the processing of type I collagen are involved in the kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasis and dermatosparaxis type of EDS. Establishing the correct EDS subtype has important implications for genetic counseling and management and is supported by specific biochemical and molecular investigations. Over the last years, several new EDS variants have been characterized which call for a refinement of the Villefranche classification.

Acute closure remains a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and underlies the majority of ischemic complications. This study details the clinical and angiographic characteristics of a series of patients receiving an intracoronary stent device to manage acute and threatened closure and presents the early clinical results. METHODS AND RESULTS. From October 1989 through June 1991, 115 patients undergoing PTCA received intracoronary stents to treat acute or threatened closure in 119 vessels. Sixty-three percent had multivessel coronary disease, 33 (29%) had undergone prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and 52 (45%) had had previous PTCA. Using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) classification, 15% of lesions were class A, 55% were class B, and 30% were class C. Eight patients were referred with severe coronary dissection and unstable angina after PTCA at other institutions. Acute closure was defined as occlusion of the vessel with TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 0 or 1 flow immediately before stent placement. Threatened closure required two or more of the following criteria: 1) a residual stenosis greater than 50%, 2) TIMI grade 2 flow, 3) angiographic dissection comprising extraluminal dye extravasation and/or a length of greater than 15 mm, 4) evidence of clinical ischemia (either typical angina or ECG changes). Twelve vessels (10%) met the criteria for acute closure, and 87 vessels (73%) satisfied the criteria for threatened closure. Twenty vessels (17%) failed to meet two criteria. Stenting produced optimal angiographic results in 111 vessels (93%), with mean diameter stenosis (+/- 1 SD) reduced from 83 +/- 12% before to 18 +/- 29% after stenting. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 1.7% and CABG was required in 4.2%; Q wave myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in 7% and non-Q wave MI in 9%. Stent thrombosis occurred in nine patients (7.6%). For the 108 patients who presented to the catheterization laboratory without evolving MI, Q wave MI occurred in 4% and non-Q wave MI occurred in 7%.

These agents are indicated for use during surgical procedures as adjunctive therapy when bleeding is not controlled by conventional methods. Early clinical data on absorbable hemostatic agents revealed a beneficial effect with regard to controlling capillary bleeding, achieving hemostasis during vascular surgery, and controlling bleeding from fistula-puncture sites. Few randomized controlled clinical trials have directly compared available agents, but case reports describing the efficacy of absorbable hemostatic agents in specific situations, especially unlabeled uses of thrombin, abound. Existing trials have compared the efficacy of established agents with newer agents, including fibrin sealants, with varying results. A variety of rarely occurring adverse effects have been reported with the administration of absorbable hemostatic agents; some of these rare effects, such as paralysis, are quite severe. No standardized dosing regimens are available for these agents, although surgeons may have a preference for a particular regimen based on their own clinical experience. No drug interactions involving absorbable hemostatic agents have been published; however, the use of these agents with other medications that affect hemostasis may disrupt clot formation.Absorbable hemostatic agents are useful as adjunctive therapy during surgical procedures when conventional methods do not control bleeding.

However, development of radiation-induced skin changes is a significant adverse effect of radiation therapy (RT). Cutaneous repercussions of RT vary considerably in severity, course, and prognosis. When they do occur, cutaneous changes to RT are commonly graded as acute, consequential-late, or chronic. Acute reactions can have severe sequelae that impact quality of life as well as cancer treatment. Thus, dermatologists should be informed about these adverse reactions, know how to assess their severity and be able to determine course of management. The majority of measures currently available to prevent these acute reactions are proper skin hygiene and topical steroids, which limit the severity and decrease symptoms. Once acute cutaneous reactions develop, they are treated according to their severity. Treatments are similar to those used in prevention, but incorporate wound care management that maintains a moist environment to hasten recovery. Chronic changes are a unique subset of adverse reactions to RT that may develop months to years following treatment. Chronic radiation dermatitis is often permanent, progressive, and potentially irreversible with substantial impact on quality of life.

From January 2017 to September 2018, a total of 227 patients were enrolled. Final follow-up was in October 2018.Eligible patients were randomized to LTG (n = 113) or OTG (n = 114) by an interactive web response system.The primary outcome was the morbidity and mortality within 30 days following surgeries between LTG and OTG with a noninferiority margin of 10%. The secondary outcomes were recovery courses and postoperative hospital stays.A total of 214 patients were analyzed for morbidity and mortality (105 patients in the LTG group and 109 patients in the OTG group). The mean (SD) age was 59.8 (9.4) years in the LTG group and 59.4 (9.2) years in the OTG group, and most were male (LTG group, 75 of 105 [71.4%]; OTG group, 80 of 109 [73.4%]).

However, no standardized method exists for grading and reporting complications in orthopaedic surgery. Conclusions regarding outcomes are incomplete without a standardized, objective complication grading scheme applied concurrently. The general surgery literature has the Clavien-Dindo classification that meets the above criteria.We asked whether a previously reported classification would show high intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities when modified for orthopaedic surgery specifically looking at hip preservation surgery. We therefore determined the interreader and intrareader reliabilities of the adapted classification scheme as applied to hip preservation surgery.We adapted the validated Clavien-Dindo complication classification system and tested its reliability for orthopaedic surgery, specifically hip preservation surgery. There are five grades based on the treatment required to manage the complication and the potential for long-term morbidity. Forty-four complication scenarios were created from a prospective multicenter database of hip preservation procedures and from the literature. Ten readers who perform hip surgery at eight centers in three countries graded the scenarios at two different times. Fleiss' and Cohen's κ statistics were performed for interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities, respectively.The overall Fleiss' κ value for interobserver reliability was 0.887 (95% CI, 0.855-0.891).

The Cohen's κ value for intraobserver reliability was 0.891 (95% CI, 0.857-0.925).The adapted classification system shows high interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities for grading of complications when applied to orthopaedic surgery looking at complications of hip preservation surgery.

Many recommendations have been made for management of necrotizing pancreatitis, but no published guidelines have incorporated the many recent developments in minimally invasive techniques for necrosectomy. Hence, a multidisciplinary conference was convened to develop a consensus on interventions for necrotizing pancreatitis. Participants included most international experts from multiple disciplines. The evidence for efficacy of interventions was reviewed, presentations were given by experts, and a consensus was reached on each topic. In summary, intervention is primarily indicated for infected necrosis, less often for symptomatic sterile necrosis, and should ideally be delayed as long as possible, preferably 4 weeks or longer after the onset of disease, for better demarcation and liquefaction of the necrosis. Both the step-up approach using percutaneous drainage followed by minimally invasive video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement and per-oral endoscopic necrosectomy have been shown to have superior outcomes to traditional open necrosectomy with respect to short-term and long-term morbidity and are emerging as treatments of choice.

Data from pregnancies complicated by trauma from July 1987 through October 1993 were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical analysis included Chi-square and Kruskall-Wallis testing. There were 476 medical records available for review. Of the trauma cases, 54.6% were motor vehicle accidents, 22.3% were domestic abuse and assaults, 21.8% were associated with falls, and 1.3% were secondary to burns, puncture wounds, or animal bites. Mean maternal age was 24 years, 49.9% were Caucasian, and 43% were primigravid. Mean ges-tational age at occurrence of trauma was 25.9 weeks and mean gestational age of delivery was 37.9 weeks. Domestic abuse occurred most frequently before 18 weeks, falls between 20-30 weeks' gestation, and motor vehicle accidents occurred with equal frequency throughout gestation. Uterine contractions occurred in 39.8% of patients and as often as every 1 to 5 min in 18% of patients. Preterm labor occurred in 11.4%, preterm delivery in 25%, and abruptions in 1.58% of the trauma population. Fetal heart rate monitoring was abnormal in 3% of cases. Twenty-seven perinatal deaths were noted and in 14 pregnancies the deaths were related to trauma. Eight of these perinatal deaths were associated with motor vehicle accidents, four with domestic violence, and two with falls. The only preventable perinatal deaths were a twin pregnancy transferred with nonreassuring fetal heart tones. Early warning symptoms of vaginal bleeding, uterine contractions, and/or abdominal and/or uterine tenderness were not predictive of either preterm delivery or adverse pregnancy outcome, sensitivity 52%, specificity 48%. Abnormal monitoring and positive Kleihauer-Betke tests were also not predictive of adverse pregnancy outcome. However, there were no adverse outcomes directly related to trauma when monitoring was normal and early warning symptoms were absent (negative predictive value 100%). Two hundred eighty-nine Kleihauer-Betke tests were performed and only one affected management. Repetitive monitoring over several days did not uncover any patients whose heart rate tracings evolved from normal to abnormal monitoring. Given our findings that prolonged monitoring was not helpful in management of pregnant trauma patients, we support the recommendation that initial external fetal monitoring be performed for 4 hr, and, if reassuring, the patient may be sent home with precautions. We also recommend an Rh-immunoglobulin work-up for all Rh-neg-ative pregnant trauma patients, but do not recommend Kleihauer-Betke testing for Rh-positive women. Given the frequency with which trauma affects pregnancy and the difficulty encountered with identifying variables predictive of pregnancy outcome, there may be great benefits of incorporating trauma prevention into routine prenatal care.",OpenAlex,0,1,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,7.5

Etiopathogenesis behind this important complication is related to several biochemical, hemodynamic and endocrine mechanisms with a preponderant initial role assumed by polyol pathways, increment of growth factors, accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGE), activation of protein kinase C (PKC), activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and leukostasis. Chronic and sustained hyperglycemia works as a trigger to the early alterations that culminate in vascular dysfunction. Hypoxia also plays an essential role in disease progression with promotion of neovascularization and vascular dystrophies with vitreous hemorrhages induction. Thus, the accumulation of fluids and protein exudates in ocular cavities leads to an opacity augmentation of the cornea that associated to neurodegeneration results in vision loss, being this a devastating characteristic of the disease final stage. During disease progression, inflammatory molecules are produced and angiogenesis occur. Furthermore, VEGF is overexpressed by the maintained hyperglycemic environment and up-regulated by tissue hypoxia. Also pro-inflammatory mediators regulated by cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and growth factors leads to the progression of these processes, culminating in vasopermeability (diabetes macular edema) and/or pathological angiogenesis (proliferative diabetic retinopathy).

Every ""now"" is unique. Responsible persons ask themselves, ""How can I act well now?"" The answers will differ for every person, because just as every situation is unique, so is every person different from every other person. But surely there must be some algorithm that will assist us in coming to the right answer. Unfortunately, no, for there is no right answer. There is only an answer that is as appropriate as we can conclude at that moment in that situation. No written guidelines can apply appropriately to every unique situation.Unfortunately we physicians have been suckled on a fallacy: ""What's good for the goose is good for the gander."" Phrased in medical terms, ""normal findings are good, and abnormal findings are bad."" This is too simple, and often wrong.Good clinicians know that care must be personalized for it to be optimal. So-called normal findings give rough guidance, sometimes applicable to groups, but frequently wrong for individuals. Consider intraocular pressure (IOP). A normal IOP of 15 mmHg good for some and bad for others, and an abnormal IOP of 30 mmHg is good for some and bad for others. We are so bombarded by the myth of the sanctity of the standard distribution curve that it is hard to think independently and specifically. Also, unfortunately, doctors are prone to decide for patients, often on the basis of normative data that is not relevant or important for the particular patient. That we do this is not surprising, as we want to help, and so we default to what seems to be the easy, safe (non-thinking) way, in which we do not have to hold ourselves accountable for the outcome.Somebody HAS to decide, or else we would be living in an anarchical world. Also true. And because none of us knows as much as we need to know to act appropriately, we seek advice from so-called ""experts.""For us to care for people well it is essential that we consider what others recommend. So we look to experts, as we should. However, experts are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. Remember that von Graefe in 1860 recommended surgical iridectomy for all glaucoma, Elliot recommended mustard plaster between the shoulders for glaucoma, Becker based treatment on tonographic findings, Weve reported 100% success with penetrating cyclodiathermy in glaucoma, Lichter advised against laser trabeculoplasty, many thought Cypass was great, and the investigators in the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study indicated that an IOP usually around 12 mmHg was better than one usually around 20 mmHg. All wrong. What the authors of these guidelines have done excellently, is to provide a general framework on which ophthalmologists can hang pieces of evidence, so as to be able to evaluate the validity and the importance of that evidence. In doing this meticulously they have provided a valuable service to all ophthalmologists, none of whom individually have either the time or the skill to be fully informed. In their own practices the authors consider whether valid information is relevant for the particular person being considered. That process of considering relevance is essential, always. And relevance is based on the particular unique patient, unique doctor and unique situation. The only guideline the authors can provide in this regard is to remind us all to consider relevance with all patients in all situations, and from the patient's perspective. Even more important than the service to ophthalmologists is the benefit to patients that will result from thoughtful use of these guidelines.We need, also, to remember that diagnoses are generic, and that within every diagnosis there are differences. For example what does a diagnosis of primary open angle mean? Some of those affected will rapidly go blind despite the most thoughtful treatment and others will keep their sight even without treatment. What does a diagnosis of Chandler's Syndrome mean? In some, surgery works well, and, in others, poorly. So one never directs diagnosis and treatment at a condition, but rather at the person, the objective being the wellness of that person.The previous European Glaucoma Society Guidelines are used internationally.

By cross-linking fibrin chains and α2 plasmin inhibitor to fibrin, FXIIIa mechanically stabilizes fibrin and protects it from fibrinolysis. Severe deficiency of the potentially active A subunit (FXIII-A) is a rare but severe hemorrhagic diathesis. Delayed umbilical stump bleeding is characteristic, and subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intracranial bleeding occurs with a relatively high frequency in nonsupplemented patients. In addition, impaired wound healing and spontaneous abortion in women are also features of FXIII deficiency. The extremely rare B subunit deficiency results in milder bleeding symptoms. FXIII concentrate is now available for on-demand treatment and primary prophylaxis. A quantitative FXIII activity assay is recommended as a screening test for the diagnosis of FXIII deficiency. For classification purposes, FXIII-A2B2 antigen in the plasma is first determined, and if decreased, further measurement of the individual subunits is recommended in the plasma and FXIII-A in platelet lysate. Analytical aspects of FXIII activity and antigen assays are discussed in this article.

After more than three decades of progress, surgical-technical pancreas graft failure rates have decreased to approximately 8%. The most recent developments in this area are systematically reviewed in this article. Recent findings Vascular graft thrombosis remains, by far, the most common cause of technical graft failure. Recent reports suggested that pancreas preservation with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution (HTK) might be a risk factor for reperfusion pancreatitis, graft thrombosis and decreased short- and long-term graft survival. It remains unclear whether these results are, at least in part, related to HTK flush volumes and extended preservation (e.g.,>12 h). For selected thrombosed pancreas grafts, there has been renewed interest in pharmacological, interventional, and surgical salvage. For selected recipients with early pancreas graft thrombosis not amenable to a salvage intervention, transplant pancreatectomy in conjunction with immediate retransplantation has emerged as a viable option. For graft thrombosis prevention, the enhanced backtable pancreas vascular reconstruction techniques (e.g., gastroduodenal artery revascularization) proposed by some authors await more formal study. For prevention of native vascular complications in high-risk recipients, several technical modifications have been reported. Developments with respect to other surgical complications (wound infection, pancreatitis, leak, and bleeding) have been more incremental. Conclusion Recent evidence underscores the importance of judicious donor and recipient selection and of optimization of preservation and surgical factors for excellent short- and long-term pancreas transplant outcomes.",OpenAlex,0,1,2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,hemorrhage,4.5

In patients with grade 2 lacerations no complications resulted from nonoperative treatment. However, 23.5% of patients in group 1 with grades 3 and 4 injuries had delayed renal bleeding versus none in group 2.Nonoperative treatment of penetrating renal lacerations is appropriate in hemodynamically stable patients without associated injuries.

Others have absolute contraindication to receive reperfusion therapies. Venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) might lower their right ventricular overload, improve hemodynamic status, and restore tissue oxygenation. ECMO-related complications and 90-day mortality were analyzed for 17 highly unstable, ECMO-treated, massive PE patients admitted to a tertiary-care center (2006–2015). Hospital- discharge survivors were assessed for long-term health-related quality of life. A systematic review of this topic was also conducted. Seventeen high-risk PE patients [median age 51 (range 18–70) years, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) 78 (45–95)] were placed on VA-ECMO for 4 (1–12) days. Among 15 (82%) patients with pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, seven (41%) were cannulated during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and eight (47%) underwent pre-ECMO thrombolysis. Pre-ECMO median blood pressure, pH, and blood lactate were, respectively: 42 (0–106) mmHg, 6.99 (6.54–7.37) and 13 (4–19) mmol/L. Ninety-day survival was 47%. Fifteen (88%) patients suffered in-ICU severe hemorrhages with no impact on survival. Like other ECMO-treated patients, ours reported limitations of all physical domains but preserved mental health 19 (4–69) months post-ICU discharge. VA-ECMO could be a lifesaving rescue therapy for patients with high-risk, acute, massive PE when thrombolytic therapy fails or the patient is too sick to benefit from surgical thrombectomy. Because heparin-induced clot dissolution and spontaneous fibrinolysis allows ECMO weaning within several days, future studies should investigate whether VA-ECMO should be the sole therapy or completed by additional mechanical clot-removal therapies in this setting.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,6.0

Methods: A cohort of patients 55 years of age or older with closed head injuries taken to a tertiary trauma center between April 1993 and March 2001 was retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics, mechanism of injury, type and severity of injury, and hospital survival data were obtained from the trauma registry. Each case then was reviewed for completeness of information, assessment of preinjury warfarin use, and comorbidity. Results: Among the 384 patients presenting with closed head injuries, 35 (9%) were receiving warfarin before their trauma. As compared with nonusers, anticoagulated patients had a higher frequency of isolated head trauma (54% vs. 32%; p = 0.008), more severe head injuries (65.7% vs. 44.1%; p = 0.02), and a higher rate of mortality (40% vs. 21%, p = 0.01). These associations remained evident even after population differences in age, gender, comorbidities, and mechanism of injury were taken into account. Indeed, according to multivariate logistic regression models, warfarin use was associated with a statistically significant risk of death (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22–6.12), statistically significant odds for more severe head injury (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.10–5.17), and odds for isolated head injury that almost reached statistical significance (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.82–3.90). Conclusions: Among patients 55 years of age or older who present with closed head injury, the use of warfarin before trauma appears to be associated with a higher frequency of isolated head trauma, more severe head trauma, and a higher likelihood of death.

Pre- and probiotics (synbiotics) are potentially useful for prevention of these infections. Summary Background Data: First trials in patients following major abdominal surgery including liver transplantation using one Lactobacillus (LAB) and one fiber showed significant reduction of infection rates and reduced length of antibiotic therapy compared with a control group. The present study was designed to analyze whether a combination of different LAB and fibers would further improve outcome. Methods: A prospective randomized monocentric double-blind trial was undertaken in 80 patients following pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD). All patients received enteral nutrition immediately postoperatively. One group (A) received a composition of 4 LAB and 4 fibers, and another group (B) received placebo (fibers only) starting the day before surgery and continuing for 8 days. Thirty-day infection rate, length of hospital stay, duration of antibiotic therapy, noninfectious complications, and side effects were recorded. Results: The incidence of postoperative bacterial infections was significantly lower with LAB and fibers (12.5%) than with fibers only (40%). In addition, the duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter in the latter group. Fibers and LAB were well tolerated. Conclusion: Early enteral nutrition supplemented with a mixture of LAB and fibers reduces bacterial infection rates and antibiotic therapy following PPPD. Pre- and probiotics (synbiotics) are potentially useful for the prevention of postoperative bacterial infections.

Methods: We studied a cohort of 969 women delivered by cesarean between May and August 1997. Infections were determined by examinations during ward rounds, reviews of laboratory results, and follow-up for 30 days after discharge. Risk factors were identified by multiple logistic regression. Results: Surgical complications were rare. There were febrile morbidity and infection complications in 16.2% and 12.4% of subjects, respectively. Eighty-five subjects had 95 surgical site infections (9.8%), and seven risk factors were independently associated with infection. Risk factors included preoperative remote infection (adjusted odd ratio [OR] 16.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1, 128.3); chorioamnionitis (OR 10.6, 95% CI 2.1, 54.2); maternal preoperative condition (OR 5.3 for those with severe systemic disease [American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥3], 95% CI 1.2, 24.0); preeclampsia (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1, 4.9); higher body mass index (OR 2.0 for every five-unit increment, 95% CI 1.3, 3.0); nulliparity (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.2); and increased surgical blood loss (OR 1.3 for every 100-mL increment, 95% CI 1.1, 1.5).

The gold standard of safely assessing depth, extent of injury, and appropriate therapeutic regimen is esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The objective of this study was to report our clinical experience and to evaluate the role of a 6-point EGD classification system of injury in predicting outcomes in adult patients diagnosed with caustic agent ingestion.The study was a retrospective medical chart review from 273 patients admitted to the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Tao-Yuan, Taiwan between June 1999 and July 2006 for treatment of caustic ingestion. The patients underwent EGD within 24 hours of admission and mucosal damage was graded using Zagar's modified endoscopic classification scheme. After treatment, patients were followed in the outpatient clinic for a minimum of 6 months.A total of 273 patients were included for analysis. Grade 3b injury was the most common caustic injury (n = 82, 30.03%), followed by grade 2b injuries (n = 62, 22.71%). Stricture was the most common complication (n = 66, 24.18%), followed by aspiration pneumonia (n = 31, 11.36%), and respiratory failure (n = 21, 7.69%). Compared to grade 3a mucosal injury, grade 3b mucosal injuries were at greater risk of prolonged hospital stay (odds ratio [OR]: 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-4.80), ICU admission (OR: 10.82; 95% CI: 2.05-200.39), and gastrointestinal (OR: 4.15; 95% CI: 1.55-13.29) and systemic complications (OR: 4.07; 95% CI: 1.81-14.07).In patients with caustic ingestion, EGD should be performed within 12 to 24 hours and categorized according to a 6-point scale.

However, its role in cases of hemiparetic spastic CP due to intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) remains less well defined, especially regarding the potential benefit of unilateral SDR. Moreover, the majority of existing studies primarily focus on the effectiveness of SDR in reducing spasticity based on quantitative scoring systems, with no evaluation of clinically meaningful improvements in motor function. This study investigates the clinical outcomes of unilateral SDR in children with spastic hemiparetic CP resulting from IVH, with a particular focus on both the reduction of spasticity and improvements in motor function at 6 and 12 months following surgery. Materials and methods This retrospective monocentric study included 11 pediatric patients with IVH-induced hemiparetic CP who underwent a unilateral SDR between 2017 and 2023. IVH was classified using Volpe's grading system. Pre- and postoperative assessments included the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), as well as functional motor domains (sitting, standing, and walking) at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Furthermore, an additional analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between IVH severity and postoperative outcomes. Results All patients demonstrated complete resolution of spasticity following surgery, with postoperative MAS scores reduced to 0. In contrast, GMFCS levels remained unchanged in most patients, with improvement observed in only one case. Remarkably, all patients demonstrated improvements in functional motor skills at both the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, with no evidence of regression or recurrence of motor disability. No adverse events were observed. Notably, higher grades of IVH were not significantly associated with presurgical MAS scores (p=1.0) or GMFCS levels (p=0.45), and no meaningful correlation was observed between IVH severity and postoperative clinical outcomes. Conclusion Unilateral SDR is a promising and safe approach for children with hemisymptomatic CP resulting from IVH, leading to significant reductions in spasticity and sustained functional motor gains regardless of IVH severity.

While a predictive model of the non-linear correlation between advanced age and clinical outcome has been reported, no previous model has been validated. Therefore, we created a prediction model of the non-linear correlation between advanced age and clinical outcome by machine learning and validated it using a separate cohort. Data of aneurysmal SAH patients treated by surgical clipping or endovascular coiling between 2003 and 2019 were obtained from the Japanese Stroke Databank (derivation cohort, n = 9,657) and ""Predict for Outcome Study of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"" (validation cohort, n = 5,085). Generalized additive models (GAMs) for poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 3 at discharge) were fitted with age transformation using spline curves for each World Federation of Neurological Societies grade. The discrimination property and calibration plot of unadjusted and adjusted models were assessed using the validation cohort. The derivation and validation cohorts included 3,610 and 3,251 patients, respectively. Regarding discrimination, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the derivation and validation cohorts were 0.835 and 0.827, respectively, in the unadjusted model and 0.844 and 0.836, respectively, in the adjusted model. An unbiased correlation was confirmed between predicted and observed probabilities of poor outcomes. GAM could help visualize the correlation between age and clinical outcomes. Our prediction model can quantitatively aid in treatment decision-making and can be effective for most diseases and treatment settings.

This multi-site study aimed at validating a low-cost, low-fidelity cesarean hysterectomy model to support resident proficiency and increase their confidence in performing this critical procedure. Materials and methods We developed a low-fidelity, anatomically representative model for cesarean hysterectomy simulation purposes. Obstetrics and Gynecology residents at two residency programs were offered a simulation experience using the model, with a performance assessment via two validated assessment tools. The clinical case involved a 38 y/o woman with a delivery complicated by postpartum hemorrhage who failed conservative therapy and required a peripartum hysterectomy. Participants included 26 residents, postgraduate year (PGY)1 through PGY4, at two midwestern university-based obstetrics and gynecology residency programs. Results The median resident scores on the Task Specific Checklist (TSC) and Global Rating Scale (GRS) correlated with increasing PGY levels. The combined TSC+GRS score was a median of 40 out of 49 total for the PGY4 class, while the PGY1 class had a median combined TSC+GRS score of 12 of 49. The PGY2 and -3 classes had TSC+GRS scores of 14 and 28, respectively. The simulation model was well-received with a median 4/5 rating for improving comfort level with cesarean hysterectomy and a median 4/5 rating for model realism. Conclusion This study validated a cost-effective, easily reproducible model that highlights the vital anatomy relevant to a cesarean hysterectomy.

With an aging population, there is increasing attention on the prognosis of patients following surgical intervention. We developed a postoperative short-term prognostic prediction model using preoperative clinical indicators, aiming to assist in perioperative medical decision-making and management. The dataset was randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. An mRS score greater than 2 one month after discharge was considered indicative of a poor prognosis. In the training cohort, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis to identify independent risk factors and construct a prediction nomogram for poor prognosis one month after discharge. The performance of the nomogram was assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve. A Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) was also conducted to determine the net benefit threshold of the prediction model. Among the 505 participants, 18.8% (95/505) had a poor prognosis one month after discharge. The baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between the training cohort and the validation cohort. LASSO regression analysis in the training cohort reduced the predictors to four potential factors. Further multivariate logistic analyses in the training cohort identified four independent predictors: age, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, hemiparesis, and hemoglobin count. These predictors were incorporated into the nomogram prediction model. Internal validation using ROC analysis, calibration curves, and other methods demonstrated a strong correlation between the observed and predicted likelihood of poor prognosis one month after discharge.

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are standardized and valid measures obtained directly from the patients and are used to assess and compare the efficacy of healthcare services. This can help improve the service provided by the healthcare system. Therefore, this study aimed to assess PROMs during the first week post-surgery across different periodontal surgical procedures and explore their correlation with surgical duration. Furthermore, the study sought to evaluate the occurrence of postoperative complications. Methodology A total of 30 healthy patients with no systemic history, requiring periodontal surgical procedures such as crown lengthening (CLP), open flap debridement (OFD), and soft tissue grafting (STG) were included in the study. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was utilized for gathering PROMs concerning bleeding, swelling, bruising, and pain at intervals of days zero, three, five, and seven after the surgical procedure. Results On the surgical day and over seven days, VAS scores were the lowest for CLP and highest for STG procedures. This result is in accordance with the duration required for surgery. VAS scores for OFD were intermediate. Prevalence of 20% soft tissue graft dehiscence and 40% tenderness on palpation was observed. Swelling and bleeding were noticed in 10% and 20% of OFD cases. Conclusions One week post-surgically, the mean VAS scores were minimum for CLP, whereas maximum for STG procedures.

Clinical information of patients was analyze, and patients were divided into poor prognosis and good prognosis. Factors affecting prognosis was classified, and independent risk factors for poor prognosis were determined. Prognostic value of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission to patients with MT was assessed. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves were drawn, and Kaplan-Merier method determined whether different NIHSS scores at admission had any difference in the in-hospital survival rate of consistency index/random consistency index (CI/RI) patients treated with MT. An oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) cell model and an middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion mouse model were established, in which miR-298 expression was tested. In OGD/R cells, proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy were assessed after intervention with miR-298 and/or autophagy related gene 5 (ATG5). In MCAO mice, the infarct area was calculated, and neurological function was assessed. The relationship between miR-298 and ATG5 was explored and validated. Age, diabetes, hypertension, hemorrhage transformation, NIHSS score at admission, leukocyte, neutrophil count and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) level were associated with patient's prognosis. Diabetes, NIHSS score at admission, and hemorrhagic transformation were independent risk factors for predicting poor prognosis in patients treated with MT. NIHSS score on admission had a predictive value on patient's prognosis. miR-298 was upregulated in acute cerebral ischemia patients with MT (p<0.05), especially in those with poor prognosis. miR-298 was elevated in both cell and mouse models (p<0.05). Apoptosis and autophagy of cells were weakened after miR-298 knockdown, and infarction in the mouse brain tissues was reduced. ATG5 was a target of miR-298. Overexpressing ATG5 rescued miR-298-induced apoptosis and autophagy. In conclusion: regulation of miR-298 and ATG5 attenuates neuronal apoptosis and autophagy, providing a new strategy for brain injury after reperfusion in patients with MT.",PubMed,0,1,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,6.5

This study aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness of preoperative coronal MRI-assisted key-hole surgery for the treatment of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 30 patients diagnosed with CSR and undergoing key-hole surgery with CMRI assistance were included in the study. Various parameters, including surgical segments, incision length, disease duration, operative time, intraoperative fluoroscopy times, intraoperative blood loss, complications, and length of hospitalization, were recorded. Precise measurements of Cobb angles and intervertebral space height were taken before and after the surgical procedure. Surgical outcomes were evaluated using modified Macnab criteria, visual analogue scale (VAS), Japanese Orthopaedic Association Scores (JOA), and neck disability index (NDI). RESULTS The average duration of disease was 6.47±3.29 months, with an average incision length of 1.94±0.15 cm and operative time of 57.83±4.34 minutes. The average intraoperative blood loss was 33.70±9.28 ml, with an average of 3.50±0.73 intraoperative fluoroscopies. The average duration of hospitalization was 4.10±1.27 days. Preoperative and postoperative measurements showed no statistically significant difference in C2-C7 Cobb angles and intervertebral space height. However, there were significant improvements in postoperative VAS, NDI, and JOA scores compared to preoperative scores. The surgical effectiveness rate was 100%, with a high rate of good and excellent outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study suggest that preoperative CMRI-assisted key-hole surgery for single-segment CSR is a safe and effective treatment option with low complication rates. The clinical benefits include high security and good outcomes.

To assess the validity of the ICH score and the Surgical Swedish ICH (SwICH) score, we retrospectively reviewed surgically treated ICH patients between 2012 and 2019. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables in predicting 30-day mortality. We identified 203 patients (mean ICH score 2.7; mean SwICH score 2.0). The actual 30-day mortality was 7%, which was significantly lower than those predicted by the ICH and the SwICH scores (55% and 16%, respectively; p < 0.001). Both scores were strongly correlated with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at discharge (correlation coefficient 0.97 and 0.98; critical value 0.81). The only significant prognostic factors for the 30-day mortality by multivariate analysis were anisocoria (p = 0.03) and preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (p = 0.03).

To validate a domestic scale for assessment risk of bleeding ORACUL (ОРАКУЛ) based on an independent sample of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
External validation of the ORACUL score was carried out using database of an independent observational study RECORD-3 which comprised data from all patients hospitalized for 1 month (march-april 2015) in 47 centers of 37 cities in 21 regions of Russia. Total number of included patients was 2370, mean age 64.2±11.96 years, 821 patients (34.6%) had ST-elevation, other patients - non-ST elevation ACS.


RESULTS
The following bleeding events were registered in RECORD-3: bleedings during hospitalization (n=34, 1.43%), inhospital bleedings requiring withdrawal of antithrombotic treatment (n=16, 0.68%), inhospital bleedings, which required drug or surgical treatment or hemotransfusion (n=16, 0.68%). Forty eight hemorrhagic complications were registered during 6 months of observation after hospital discharge. Diagnostic value of the ORACUL score for estimation of risk of bleedings during index hospitalization was good (C-criterion 0.691±0.050; р<0.001), sensitivity of the model was 58.1%, specificity 79.9%. Earlier on the cohort of patients of the ORACUL study diagnostic value of the score for inhospital bleedings was found to be 0.777±0.046. Difference of diagnostic values was inessential. For estimation of the bleeding risk during 6 months of post discharge observation area under the ROC curve (C-criterion) was 0.628±0.045 (р=0.003), sensitivity and specificity of the model were 53.9 and 73.7%, respectively. On the ORACUL study cohort AUC 0.748±0.048 (р=0.071).

,,"Reply to Del Gaizo et al.'s “The SPOT GRADE: A Clinically Validated, Quantitative Bleeding Severity Scale”",Journal of Investigative Surgery,2019.0,"The authors speculate in their letter to the editor that translation of the study conclusion to human patients could potentially be more impactful when would have been based on a different bleeding severity scale (SPOT GRADE; SG). We agree that there are two validated methods available to evaluate treatment success of adjunct hemostats in vivo. However, for the following reasons, the methods applied in our manuscript are the most appropriate: Use of the Validated Interoperative Bleeding Scale (VIBe SCALE) which was validated with 102 surgeons representing 11 different surgical specialties supporting the clinical relevance of our results. Use of an additional quantitative method (blood loss rate) allowing for verification of the qualitative assessment prior to treatment and at every assessment time point after application of hemostats. By utilizing the VIBe SCALE, the clinical relevance of the animal data is maximized because the reproducibility and repeatability of the VIBe SCALE were evaluated as part of the validation process and were found to be excellent. The intraand interobserver agreement were assessed using Kendall’s W statistics. When 102 surgeons used the VIBe SCALE to score 10 different videos depicting bleeding in several different surgical specialties, the surgeons achieved a reproducibility of 0.91. Similarly, when 102 surgeons used the VIBe SCALE to score the same 5 videos twice, the surgeons had an average repeatability of 0.98 (a Kendall’s W of 0.9 is considered excellent and 1 as perfect). Furthermore, all surgeons but one stated that the scale is relevant for evaluating hemostasis in clinical studies. The SG is based on six levels of bleeding, composed of two tables, and has overlapping domains (ATLS Shock Risk Class and Expected intervention(s)). The use of the ATLS Shock Risk Class seems unclear as this scale is primarily used to initially assess severely injured trauma patients for hypovolemic shock. One table of the SG is based on objective criteria, while the second table is based on estimated flow rates. Each grade has three different flow rates based on size (e.g., Grade 2 can be 12.0ml/min per 1 cm, 20.0ml/min per 10 cm, or 28.0ml/min per 50 cm). The complex nature of the SG scale may reduce the ability to read, interpret, and apply the scale correctly. Whereas, the VIBe SCALE is based on 5 levels of bleeding, does not have overlapping domains and uses visual presentation, anatomical appearance, qualitative description, and estimated blood loss (Table 1). Concurrently, clarity and usability of the VIBe SCALE were confirmed with 80% of participating surgeons agreeing that the scale uses objective and non-overlapping terms. All participants in the validation study confirmed the scale was very or mostly self-explanatory. Further, the VIBe SCALE construct validation addressed: ability to detect change, response range, clarity, relevance, usability, and reliability (repeatability and reproducibility) and was accepted by the FDA for use in a clinical trial. Additionally, the reliability over an average test–retest period of 370 days was excellent (Kendall’s W value of 0.93). Regarding concerns of potential inaccuracies or inconsistencies of using gauze to measure bleeding rate we would like to state that utmost attention was paid to not absorb fluids other than blood.

An instrument to assess and prevent these injuries is essential. This study aimed to validate and culturally adapt the ELPO-PT for the Portuguese population to ensure its applicability and effectiveness in assessing the risk of injury from surgical positioning. Methods: A validation study was conducted with 126 adult patients undergoing surgical procedures at a central hospital in northern Portugal. Statistical analyses, including the calculation of Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, assessed the internal reliability of the scale. Additionally, sensitivity and specificity analyses evaluated the ELPO-PT’s diagnostic accuracy in identifying patients at risk of developing positioning-related injuries. Results: The validation showed a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.782, indicating reasonable internal reliability. Sensitivity analysis revealed an 85% accuracy rate in identifying patients at risk of positioning injuries, while specificity analysis demonstrated a 90% accuracy rate for patients not at risk. Conclusions: The ELPO-PT is a valid and reliable instrument for aiding nurses in clinical decision-making, with significant sensitivity and specificity in identifying the risk of positioning-related injuries, including pressure ulcers, in adult patients during the intraoperative period.

,,Validation of the HAS-BLED scale for the assessment of bleeding risk in patients on anticoagulation therapy with a diagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease.,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,2024.0,"Background
Several models have been developed to assess bleeding risk in patients with venous thromboembolism, such as HAS-BLED, but their external validity has not been adequately assessed.


Objective
The objective of the study was to evaluate the discriminative ability and calibration of the HAS-BLED scale for predicting 1-month bleeding risk in patient's anticoagulated for venous thromboembolism.


Materials and Methods
External validation study of a prediction model based on a retrospective cohort of patients with venous thromboembolism treated between November 2019 and January 2022. Calibration of the HAS-BLED scale was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the ratio of observed to expect events within each risk category. Discriminatory ability was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic curve.


Results
We included 735 patients (median age 64 years, female sex 55.2%), pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in most patients (60.7%), and 4.9% presented bleeding events. Regarding calibration, the HAS-BLED scale systematically underestimates the risk both in the general population (ROE 3.76, p < 0.001) and in cancer patients (ROE 4.16). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test rejected the hypothesis of adequate calibration (p < 0.001). Discriminatory ability was limited both in the general population (AUC = 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48-0.66) and in the subgroup with active cancer (AUC = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36-0.69).


Conclusion
The HAS-BLED scale in patients with venous thromboembolism underestimates the risk of bleeding at 1 month and has a low ability to discriminate high-risk patients.

Study design: Retrospective cohort study in a paediatric ICU from 2015 to 2020. Results: 356 children were enrolled; 59% were male with median (IQR) age 2.1 (0.5–8) years. Fifty-seven patients (16%) had severe bleeding in the first 24 hours post-operatively. Severe bleeding was observed more frequently in younger and smaller children with longer bypass and cross-clamp times (p-values <0.001), in addition to higher surgical complexity (p = 0.048). Those with severe bleeding received significantly more red blood cells, platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitate in the paediatric ICU following surgery (all p-values <0.001). No laboratory values obtained on paediatric ICU admission were able to predict severe post-operative bleeding. Those with severe bleeding had significantly less paediatric ICU-free days (p = 0.010) and mechanical ventilation-free days (p = 0.013) as compared to those without severe bleeding. Conclusions: Applying the BASIC definition to our cohort, severe bleeding occurred in 16% of children in the first day following cardiopulmonary bypass.

Assessing surgical trainees' performance requires objective, validated, and reliable evaluation tools. We developed and validated the Lung Lobectomy Performance Assessment Scale Score (LOB-PASS) to objectively evaluate lung lobectomy performance, including lymph node dissection, across different surgical approaches (postero-lateral thoracotomy, video-assisted, and robot-assisted).


METHODS
The LOB-PASS scale was developed using the Delphi consensus method and response process testing in simulation sessions. Validation was performed on 48 thoracic surgery residents, assessed by independent observers through simulation-based response testing. Internal structure was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), correlation scores from linear regression (R2), and Bland-Altman analysis. Inter-observer score comparisons were conducted using the Wilcoxon test and the F-test.


RESULTS
The final scale included 52 items categorized into seven domains: opening (n = 6), cavity exploration and lymph node dissection (n = 12), vein time (n = 5), arterial time (n = 8), bronchial time (n = 6), parenchymal time (n = 7), and closure (n = 8), with a total score of 104 points. Internal structure analysis based on 48 simulation procedures: Cronbach's alpha = 0.89, ICC = 0.92, R2 = 0.84. No significant interobserver differences were found (p > 0.05). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a mean difference of 0.19, with 95% limits of agreement ranging from -13.3 to 13.7.


CONCLUSIONS
LOB-PASS is a valid and reliable tool for assessing lung lobectomy performance with lymph node dissection across all surgical approaches. Integrating LOB-PASS into surgical training curricula could standardize competency assessment and optimize technical skill acquisition in thoracic surgery.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,15.0

Understanding the health needs from a patient's view is necessary for developing targeted supportive services. There is neither research on the postoperative health needs of primary liver cancer (PLC) patients, nor the assessment tools specifically designed for PLC patients. The purpose of this study was to develop a postoperative health needs assessment scale for PLC patients receiving surgical management. This was a methodological instrument validation study conducted in the first affiliated of Jinan University between August 2018 and December 2019. PLC patients receiving surgical management were selected by convenient sampling methods. Ten patients were selected for semi-structured in-depth interviews to generate a 50-item initial scale. After two rounds of expert consultation, a 44-item initial scale was used for a 20-respondent small sample pre-test. The pre-survey scale was distributed to 250 patients. Structural validity was examined with factor analysis, and reliability was evaluated with the Cronbach alpha and split-half reliability. Among the 250 respondents of the pre-survey scale, 232 cases completed the questionnaire. After item analysis and factor analysis, 38 items were kept in the final scale.

,,VIBe Scale: Validation of the Intraoperative Bleeding Severity Scale by Spine Surgeons,International Journal of Spine Surgery,2022.0,"Background The Validated Intraoperative Bleeding Scale (VIBe Scale) was initially validated with surgeons who operate on cardiothoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities and fulfilled criteria for a clinician-reported scale. However, there is a need for a tool to aid in intraoperative blood management during spine surgeries. The purpose of the present study was to establish the reliability and consistency of the VIBe Scale as a tool for spine surgeons to assess intraoperative bleeding. Methods Orthopedic (n = 16) and neurological (n = 9) spine surgeons scored videos depicting surgical bleeding and assessed the VIBe Scale’s relevance and clarity. Inter- and intraobserver agreement (Kendall’s W) were calculated for all surgeons and pooled with responses from the original study to establish agreement across specialties. Results All of the spine surgeons indicated that the scale was clinically relevant for evaluating hemostasis and could be implemented in a clinical study. Twenty-two spine surgeons (88%) reported that the scale represents the range of bleeding site sizes and severities expected in their practice. Twenty-four spine surgeons (96%) indicated that the scale would be useful in communicating bleeding severity with other members of the surgical team. Interobserver agreement was acceptable (0.79) for orthopedic specialists, appreciable (0.88) for neurological specialists, and appreciable (0.88) for the combined specialists. Intraobserver agreement was excellent for orthopedic (0.91) and neurological (0.91) spine surgeons and excellent (0.96) for the combined specialists. Conclusions The results highlight the reliability of the VIBe Scale and potential utility for quantifying intraoperative blood loss in spine surgery. Level of Evidence 3. Clinical Relevance The VIBe Scale may be useful for evaluating the efficacy of untested intraoperative hemostatic agents and for comparing the relative efficacy of 2 or more analogous agents. It may also prove useful for intraoperative staff by quantifying ongoing intraoperative blood loss and correlating losses with the potential transfusion and intraoperative hemostatic agent requirements.",Semantic Scholar,0,11,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,31.5
,,Bleeding Assessment Scale in Critically Ill Children (BASIC): Physician-Driven Diagnostic Criteria for Bleeding Severity.,Critical Care Medicine,2019.0,"OBJECTIVE
Although bleeding frequently occurs in critical illness, no published definition to date describes the severity of bleeding accurately in critically ill children. We sought to develop diagnostic criteria for bleeding severity in critically ill children.


DESIGN
Delphi consensus process of multidisciplinary experts in bleeding/hemostasis in critically ill children, followed by prospective cohort study to test internal validity.


SETTING
PICU.


PATIENTS
Children at risk of bleeding in PICUs.


INTERVENTIONS
None.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
Twenty-four physicians worldwide (10 on a steering committee and 14 on an expert committee) from disciplines related to bleeding participated in development of a definition for clinically relevant bleeding. A provisional definition was created from 35 descriptors of bleeding. Using a modified online Delphi process and conference calls, the final definition resulted after seven rounds of voting. The Bleeding Assessment Scale in Critically Ill Children definition categorizes bleeding into severe, moderate, and minimal, using organ dysfunction, proportional changes in vital signs, anemia, and quantifiable bleeding. The criteria do not include treatments such as red cell transfusion or surgical interventions performed in response to the bleed. The definition was prospectively applied to 40 critically ill children with 46 distinct bleeding episodes. The kappa statistic between the two observers was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.57-0.91) representing substantial inter-rater reliability.


CONCLUSIONS
The Bleeding Assessment Scale in Critically Ill Children definition of clinically relevant bleeding severity is the first physician-driven definition applicable for bleeding in critically ill children derived via international expert consensus. The Bleeding Assessment Scale in Critically Ill Children definition includes clear criteria for bleeding severity in critically ill children. We anticipate that it will facilitate clinical communication among pediatric intensivists pertaining to bleeding and serve in the design of future epidemiologic studies if it is validated with patient outcomes.",Semantic Scholar,0,28,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,hemorrhage,none,46.0

,,Validation of an Electronic Health Record-Based Machine Learning Model Compared to Clinical Risk Scores for Gastrointestinal Bleeding.,Gastroenterology,2024.0,"BACKGROUND & AIMS
Guidelines recommend use of risk stratification scores for patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) to identify very-low-risk patients eligible for discharge from emergency departments. Machine learning models may outperform existing scores and can be integrated within the electronic health record (EHR) to provide real-time risk assessment without manual data entry. We present the first EHR-based machine learning model for GIB.


METHODS
The training cohort comprised 2,546 patients and internal validation of 850 patients presenting with overt GIB (hematemesis, melena, hematochezia) to emergency departments of 2 hospitals from 2014-2019. External validation was performed on 926 patients presenting to a different hospital with the same EHR from 2014-2019. The primary outcome was a composite of red-blood-cell transfusion, hemostatic intervention (endoscopic, interventional radiologic, or surgical), and 30-day all-cause mortality. We used structured data fields in the EHR available within 4 hours of presentation and compared performance of machine learning models to current guideline-recommended risk scores, Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) and Oakland Score. Primary analysis was area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Secondary analysis was specificity at 99% sensitivity to assess proportion of patients correctly identified as very-low-risk.


RESULTS
The machine learning model outperformed the GBS (AUC=0.92 vs. 0.89;p<0.001) and Oakland score (AUC=0.92 vs. 0.89;p<0.001). At the very-low-risk threshold of 99% sensitivity, the machine learning model identified more very-low-risk patients: 37.9% vs. 18.5% for GBS and 11.7% for Oakland score (p<0.001 for both comparisons).


CONCLUSIONS
An EHR-based machine learning model performs better than currently recommended clinical risk scores and identifies more very-low-risk patients eligible for discharge from the emergency department.",Semantic Scholar,0,2,0,0,0,6,False,False,False,True,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,27.0
,,Development and validation of a cynomolgus macaque grimace scale for acute pain assessment,Scientific Reports,2023.0,"Cynomolgus macaques may undergo surgical procedures for scientific and veterinary purposes. Recognition and assessment of pain using validated tools is a necessary first step for adequately managing pain in these primates. Grimace scales are one means of assessing the occurance of acute pain using action units such as facial expressions and posture. The aim of this study was to create and validate a Cynomolgus Macaque Grimace Scale (CMGS). Cynomolgus macaques (n = 43) were video recorded before and after a surgical procedure. Images were extracted from videos at timepoints at which breakthrough pain might be expected based on analgesic pharmacokinetics. Using the CMGS images were scored by 12 observers blinded to animal identification, times, and conditions. To validate the tool, detailed behavioral analyses emphasizing changes to baseline activity ethograms were compared to grimace scores. Four action units were identified related to potential pain including orbital tightening, brow lowering, cheek tightening, and hunched posture. The CMGS tool was found to have moderate inter- (ICC_average action unit mean ± SD: 0.67 ± 0.28) and good intra- (ICC_single mean ± SD: 0.79 ± 0.14) observer reliability. Grimace scores increased significantly (p < 0.0001) in the first four post-operative timepoints compared to baseline, correlating with behavioral findings (rho range = 0.22–0.35, p < 0.001). An analgesic intervention threshold was determined and should be considered when providing additional pain relief. The CMGS was shown to be a reliable and valid tool; however, more research is needed to confirm external validity.

Method: analytical, longitudinal and quantitative study. An instrument and the scale were used in the three perioperative phases in 106 patients. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: most patients showed high risk for perioperative injuries, both in the scale score with estimated time and in the real-time score, with a mean of 19.97 (±3.02) and 19.96 (±3.12), respectively. Most participants did not show skin lesions (87.8%) or pain (92.5%). Inferential analysis enabled us to assert that the scale scores are associated with the appearance of injuries resulting from positioning, therefore, it can adequately predict that low-risk patients are unlikely to have injuries and those at high risk are more likely to develop injuries. Conclusion: the scale validation is shown by the association of scores with the appearance of injuries, therefore, it is a valid and useful tool, and it can guide the clinical practice of perioperative nurses in rehabilitation hospitals in order to reduce risk for injuries due to surgical positioning.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,12.0

Scales facilitate this type of assessment, but most of these measuring instruments are in different languages. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) is one of the most robust instruments available in the literature for the evaluation of scars, although there is no validated version in Brazilian Portuguese. The aims of this study were to culturally translate and validate POSAS for the Portuguese language of Brazil and to test its reproducibility, face validity, content, and construct. Following the methodology proposed by Beaton DE, Bombardier C, Guillemin F, Ferraz, MB, Spine 2000, 25, 3186, the questionnaire was translated and adapted to the Brazilian culture. The reproducibility, face, content, and construct validity were then analysed. In all, the scale was applied to 35 patients with postoperative scars (patient version) and 35 hand surgery specialists (version for the observer). The internal consistency was tested by Cronbach's alpha, and construct validation was performed by correlating the translated instrument with the Brazilian Portuguese translation of the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). The cultural adaptation of POSAS Escola Paulista de Medicina/Universidade Federal de São Paulo (EPM/UNIFESP) was confirmed. Both subscales showed strong internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.77‐0.93), demonstrating reliability. The reproducibility was excellent, and the adapted scale demonstrated significant intra‐ and inter‐observer reproducibility (r > 0.9) (P < 0.05). The validity of the construct was significant and showed good sensitivity between POSAS EMP/UNIFESP and the VSS.

Results: Our results did not validate the adequacy and prognostic performance of the 16 factors in the model for prediction of constipation risk at the time of hospitalisation. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed good adequacy in the final model; however, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the final model, which represents its discriminatory performance, was 0.64 after correction for optimism. Therefore, the model had insufficient accuracy for predicting constipation risk in patients hospitalised in various medical and surgical departments.Conclusions: Laxative intake and bowel habits were independently associated with constipation risk on the fourth day of hospitalisation.Relevance to clinical practice: Although our results did not validate the clinical usefulness of the scale, we identified three independent risk factors for constipation: laxative intake, polymedication, and intestinal problems.

Design Anatomic models were designed with a process of serial anatomic segmentation/design, 3D printing, dissection, and device refinement. A validation study was conducted with 5 junior and 5 senior plastic surgery residents. The validation study incorporated a multiple-choice Knowledge Assessment test (KA), an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical skills (OSATs), a Global Rating Scale (GRS) and a Michigan Standard Simulation Experience Scale (MiSSES). We compared the scores of both the junior and senior residents and compared junior resident scores, before and after viewing a lecture/demonstration. Results MiSSES showed high face validity with a score of 85.1/90, signifying high satisfaction with the simulator learning experience. Simulation and the lecture/demonstration improved the junior resident average KA score from 5.6/10 to 9.6/10 (P = .02), OSATs score from 32.4/66 to 64.4/66 (P < .001) and GRS score from 13.9/35 to 27.5/35 (P < .001).

,,Pre-Operative Coagulation Test Results Do Not Correlate with Self-Bleeding Assessment Tool (Self-BAT) Scores,Blood,2023.0,"
 Background: Elective surgical procedures are planned hemostatic challenges and laboratory coagulation testing is often the typical approach to pre-operative hemostatic assessments. This is unfortunate as the prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] are of suboptimal predictive value for surgical bleeding risk and are have limited screening ability for inherited bleeding disorders. To the contrary, personal and family history of bleeding are important predictors of inherited bleeding disorders, and thus also likely predictive of perioperative bleeding risk. Quantitative bleeding assessment tools (BATs) have been developed to standardize the patient bleeding history, and a patient self-administered BAT (Self-BAT) has been validated for the diagnosis of type 1 von Willebrand disease. As part of a large, multicentre prospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of the Self-BAT in predicting peri-operative bleeding, we aimed to determine the correlation between results of coagulation assays and the Self-BAT score in patients undergoing elective surgery.
 Methods: We enrolled adult patients with no previously identified bleeding disorder who were undergoing general elective surgery between 2017 to 2018. We excluded patients with any prior history of therapeutic dose antithrombotic use, and those undergoing cardiac, vascular, emergency, ophthalmologic, or dental surgeries. Bloodwork was drawn at the pre-operative visit, and included aPTT, PT, von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen, VWF GP1b (ristocetin calibrated) activity, factor VIII activity, platelet function assay (PFA)-100 closure times. The pre-operative Self-BAT and all laboratory tests were analyzed at the same site . We used Spearman's correlation coefficient to determine the relationship between results of laboratory testing and the Self-BAT scores. An abnormal Self-BAT score was defined as ≥6 for women and ≥4 for men. R v4.3.1 was used to perform the analysis.
 Results: A total of 368 were enrolled in the study, the mean age was 56 years old (standard deviation: 14.4) and 64.3% were women. A total of 12 individuals (3.3%) had a first degree relative with a bleeding disorder. The most common planned procedure was orthopedic (61%), followed by neurosurgery (14.4%), and general surgery (8.2%). The median Self-BAT score for women was 2 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1-4.3) and 1 (IQR: 0-2) for men. Of the 236 women and 131 men, 42 (17.8%) and 17 (13%) had abnormal Self-bat score. We found no significant correlations between the aPTT PT, Factor VIII, VWF panel nor PFA-100 and the Self-BAT score (Table 1). There was also no correlation found for sex stratified analyses.
 Conclusions: Our findings confirm that unselected ‘routine’ and specialized coagulation test results do not correlate with an individual's bleeding history. Thus, indiscriminate testing should not be used as surrogate screening tests for bleeding disorders in the pre-operative setting. Specialized coagulation testing should be reserved for when a hemostatic defect is suspected based on a positive personal or family bleeding history. We look forward to the results of the primary objective of the larger cohort study; enrollment is more than half completed to determine if the Self-BAT score itself is an accurate predictor of peri-operative bleeding.",Semantic Scholar,0,18,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,hemorrhage,none,29.0
,,Development and validation of an objective assessment scale for chest tube insertion under ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ rating,BMC Medical Education,2018.0,"There is an increasing need for objective and validated educational concepts. This holds especially true for surgical procedures like chest tube insertion (CTI). Thus, we developed an instrument for objectification of learning successes: the assessment scale based on Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) for chest tube insertion, which is evaluated in this study. Primary endpoint was the evaluation of intermethod reliability (IM). Secondary endpoints are ‘indirect’ interrater reliability (IR) and construct validity of the scale (CV). Every participant (N = 59) performed a CTI on a porcine thorax. Participants received three ratings (one ‘direct’ on site, two ‘indirect’ via video rating). IM compares ‘direct’ with ‘indirect’ ratings. IR was assessed between ‘indirect’ ratings. CV was investigated by subgroup analysis based on prior experience in CTI for ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ rating. We included 59 medical students to our study. IM showed moderate conformity (‘direct’ vs. ‘indirect 1’ ICC = 0.735, 95% CI: 0.554–0.843; ‘direct’ vs. ‘indirect 2’ ICC = 0.722, 95% CI 0.533–0.835) and good conformity between ‘direct’ vs. ‘average indirect’ rating (ICC = 0.764, 95% CI: 0.6–0.86). IR showed good conformity (ICC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.707–0.91). CV was proven between subgroups in ‘direct’ (p = 0.037) and ‘indirect’ rating (p = 0.013). Results for IM suggest equivalence for ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ ratings, while both IR and CV was demonstrated in both rating methods.

LOI was described as requiring more support at discharge and mortality was defined as death occurring up to 30 days following surgery. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the ability of the srEFS to predict the outcomes of interest in relation to the EFS. Results Five hundred thirty-five patients were included. Exploratory analysis confirmed best positive predictive value for srEFS was greater or equal to 5. Overall, 113 (21 percent) patients were considered high risk for frailty (HRF) and 179 (33 percent) patients had an OSS greater or equal to 5. LOI occurred in 7 percent (38 patients) and the mortality rate was 4 percent (21 patients). ROC analysis showed that the srEFS performed similar to the standard EFS with no difference in discriminatory thresholds for predicting LOI and mortality. Examination of the domains of the EFS not included in the srEFS demonstrated a lack of association between cognitive decline and the outcomes of interest. However, functional status assessed with either the Get up and Go (EFS only) or self-reported ADLs was independently associated with increased risk for LOI. Conclusion This study shows that self-reported EFS may be an optional preoperative tool that can be used in the virtual setting to identify patients at HRF. Early identification of patients at risk for LOI and mortality provides an opportunity to implement targeted strategies to improve patient care.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,9.0

,,Development and Validation of a Performance Assessment Scale for Chest Tube Insertion in Traumatic Pneumothorax,Journal of Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine,2016.0,"Background: Insertion of a chest tube is a potentially dangerous procedure in cases of pneumothorax. Different chest tube insertion techniques have been described. In a trauma setting, surgical approach should be aimed at diminishing the number of complications. Even though simulation-based training has facilitated enhanced performance of this procedure, no assessment scale has been published to date. 
Objective: The objective of this study was to design and validate a performance assessment scale for surgical chest tube insertion in traumatic pneumothorax. 
Methods: The scale content (8 steps, 20 items with a total over 20) was designed by three experts on the basis of international recommendations and Advanced Trauma Life Support courses, and adjusted after testing on 9 senior physicians. 104 participants were included for psychometric analysis of the scale. The model employed was a previously developed surgical chest tube insertion simulator. Assessment was carried out by two independent observers chosen from among a group of 6. 
Results: Mean score of participants registered to the university course was 13.51 ± 3.36 (n=104). Cronbach alpha was 0.747 and intraclass coefficient was 0.966 reflecting respectively good coherence and excellent interobserver reproducibility. The score was able to conclusively discriminate between success and failure of insertion (p<0.0001). Both assessment scores and success rates were found to correlate with level of training (Rho=0.76 and 0.66 respectively, p<0.0001). 
Conclusion: This performance assessment scale was found to be consistent and reliable for surgical chest tube insertion procedure in traumatic pneumothorax.

,,Early detection of ocular lesions in critically ill children: Testing an ocular assessment scale.,Nursing in critical care,2023.0,"OBJECTIVE
There is scarcity of data on the incidence and factors associated with the occurrence of ocular lesions in critically ill children. The objective was to test the applicability and utility of an ocular assessment scale and to identify risk factors of ocular lesions.


DESIGN
Prospective observational study.


SETTING
A tertiary care medical-surgical Paediatric Intensive Care Unit.


SAMPLE
194 children without previous ocular disease who stayed in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit for more than 48 h.


INTERVENTIONS
An ocular lesions risk scale was designed including risk factors lagophthalmos, eye dryness, conjunctival hyperemia, slow blinking, intubation, sedation, relaxation, face mask and hemodynamic instability. Patients were classified as high-, medium-, and low-risk patients. Corneal lesions were examined by fluorescein staining according to their risk and were confirmed by an ophthalmologist.


RESULTS
76 patients were examined with fluorescein staining. Thirty-two ocular lesions were detected by nursing staff, 26 confirmed by the ophthalmologist. 53.6% of the high-risk patients developed a corneal lesion. Univariate analysis revealed an association between ocular damage and all factors included in the scale, except for face mask. In the multivariate analysis, ocular lesions were associated with lagophthalmos, hyperemia, invasive mechanical ventilation and inotropic support.


CONCLUSIONS
The scale was useful to detect corneal lesions in critically ill children. The identification of risk factors will enable the development of measures to reduce the incidence of ocular lesions.

Despite advances in imaging technology, intraoperative bleeding remains a significant obstacle to optimal visibility, with subjective evaluation methods lacking consistency and standardization. This study proposes a novel image processing system to objectively quantify bleeding and assess surgical effectiveness. The system uses color recognition algorithms to calculate a bleeding score based on pixel ratios by incorporating multiple color spaces to enhance accuracy and minimize errors. Moreover, 200 three-second video clips from prior arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs were evaluated by three senior surgeons trained on the system’s color metrics and scoring process. Assessments were repeated two weeks later to test intraobserver reliability. The system’s scores were compared to the average score given by the surgeons. The average surgeon-assigned score was 5.10 (range: 1–9.66), while the system scored videos from 1 to 9.46, with an average of 5.08. The mean absolute error between system and surgeon scores was 0.56, with a standard deviation of 0.50, achieving agreement ranging from [0.96,0.98] with 96.7% confidence (ICC = 0.967).

The Munro Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment Scale for Perioperative Patients - Adult (Munro scale) is a pressure ulcer/injury risk assessment scale for adult surgical patients. It consists of 3 sections relating to the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. It is not available in Italian.


PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to translate the Munro scale into Italian and assess its cross-cultural content and face validity.


METHODS
The translation and cross-cultural adaptation process adhered to World Health Organization guidelines including forward translation, expert review, and back translation. Health care professionals with a minimum of 5 years of experience working in the operating rooms of different hospitals in northern Italy were invited to participate in a content and face validation of the translated instrument. Content validity was evaluated by rating the relevance of each scale item using a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not relevant) to 4 (very relevant). Face validity (comprehensibility and clarity) was also measured using a 4-point rating scale.


RESULTS
Expert agreement of the translated instrument reached a Fleiss' kappa of 0.95. The content validity index was 0.91, and all items had a score ≥ 3 for clarity and comprehensibility.


CONCLUSION
The Italian version of the Munro scale can be used safely to assess patient risk of injuries during the perioperative period in Italy.

,,Preoperative bleeding risk assessment in cardiac surgery patients,Clinical Medicine (Russian Journal),2024.0,"One of the most important aspects in achieving successful outcomes in cardiac surgery is the evaluation of the risk of bleeding during and after the procedure. Preoperative anemia, intraoperative bleeding, and transfusion therapy contribute to a cumulative risk of adverse events. Given the limitations of traditional coagulation tests, a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach is necessary. Factors affecting the risk of bleeding should be considered from the perspective of both individual patient characteristics and the specific type and extent of the planned surgical intervention. The risk assessment should be informed by individual and familial history, as well as previous episodes of bleeding or other relevant information. The use of bleeding risk scales can play a crucial role in this process, providing valuable insights into the likelihood of bleeding complications.

,,Validation of the Pictorial Fit-Frail Scale in a Thoracic Surgery Clinic,Annals of Surgery,2022.0,"Objective: Examine feasibility and construct validity of Pictorial Fit-Frail scale (PFFS) for the first time in older surgical patients. Background: The PFFS uses visual images to measure health state in 14 domains and has been previously validated in outpatient geriatric clinics. Methods: Patients ≥65 year-old who were evaluated in a multidisciplinary thoracic surgery clinic from November 2020 to May 2021 were prospectively included. Patients completed an in-person PFFS and Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) during their visit, and a frailty index was calculated from the PFFS (PFFStrans). A geriatrician performed a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) either in-person or virtually, from which a Frailty Index (FI-CGA) and Frailty Questionnaire (FRAIL) scale were obtained. To assess the validity of the PFFS in this population, the Spearman rank correlations (rspearman) between PFFStrans and VES-13, FI-CGA, FRAIL were calculated. Results: All 49 patients invited to participate agreed, of which 46/49 (94%) completed the PFFS so a score could be calculated. The majority of patients (59%) underwent an in-person CGA and the reminder (41%) a virtual CGA. The cohort was mainly female (59.0%), with a median age of 77 (range: 67–90). The median PFFStrans was 0.27 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.12-0.34), PFFS was 11 (IQR 5–14), and 0.24 (IQR 0.13–0.32) for FI-CGA. We observed a strong correlation between the PFFStrans and FI-CGA (rspearman = 0.81, P < 0.001) and a moderate correlation between PFFStrans and VES-13 and FRAIL score (rspearman = 0.68 and 0.64 respectively, P < 0.001).

We introduced a competency assessment tool for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our residency program. Our aim was to assess the inter-rater reliability of this tool. We included all laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed by residents under the supervision of board certified surgeons. All residents were assessed at the end of the procedure by the supervising surgeon (live reviewer) using our competency assessment tool. Video records of the same procedure were analyzed by two independent reviewers (reviewer A and B), who were blinded to the performing trainee’s. The assessment had three parts: a laparoscopic cholecystectomy-specific assessment tool (LCAT), the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) and a 5-item visual analogue scale (VAS) to address the surgeon’s autonomy in each part of the cholecystectomy. We compared the assessment scores of the live supervising surgeon and the video reviewers. We included 15 junior residents who performed 42 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Scoring results from live and video reviewer were comparable except for the OSATS and VAS part. The score for OSATS by the live reviewer and reviewer B were 3.68 vs. 4.26 respectively (p = 0.04) and for VAS (5.17 vs. 4.63 respectively (p = 0.03).

Current scales for evaluating unilateral cleft lip/nose (UCL/N) aesthetic outcomes are limited in their reliability, ease of use, and application. The Unilateral Cleft Lip Surgical Outcomes Evaluation (UCL SOE) scale measures symmetry of 4 components and sums these for a total score. The purpose of this study was to validate the SOE as a reliable tool for use by both surgeons and laypersons. Methods: Twenty participants (9 surgeons and 12 laypeople) used the SOE to evaluate 25 sets of randomly selected presurgical and postsurgical standardized photographs of UCL/N patients. Interrater reliability for surgeon and laypeople was determined using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Individual surgeons and laypeople both reached an ICC in the ""fair to good"" range (ICC = 0.42 and 0.59, respectively). Averaging 2 evaluators in the surgeon group improved the ICC to 0.58 and in the laypeople group to 0.74, respectively. Averaging 3 evaluators increased the ICC for surgeons to the ""good"" range (ICC = 0.71) and the ICC for laypeople to the ""very good"" range (ICC = 0.82). Conclusions: Surgeon and layperson raters can reliably use the SOE to assess the aesthetics results after surgical repair of UCL/N, and improved reliability and reproducibility is achieved by averaging the scores of multiple reviewers.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,4,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,17.0

,,Validation of the imperial college surgical assessment device for spinal anesthesia,BMC Anesthesiology,2017.0,"BackgroundTraditionally, technical proficiency for spinal anesthesia has been assessed using observational scales such as global rating scales or task specific checklists. However more objective metrics are required in order to improve novice’s training programs. The aim of this study is to validate the hand motion analysis of the Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device (ICSAD) in a simulated model of spinal anesthesia.MethodsThree groups of physicians with different levels of experience were video recorded performing a spinal anesthesia in a simulated lumbar puncture torso. Participants’ technical performance was assessed with ICSAD, a Global Rating Scale (GRS) and a specific Checklist. Differences between the 3 groups were determined by Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons. Spearman correlation coefficient between ICSAD variables and the scores of the observational scales were calculated to establish concurrent validity.ResultsThirty subjects participated in the study: ten novice (first year residents), 10 intermediate (third year residents) and 10 experts (attending anesthesiologists).

Patients with VWD can experience bruising, mucocutaneous bleeding, and bleeding after dental and surgical procedures. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to minimize the risk of these complications. Several bleeding assessment tools (BATs) have been used to quantify bleeding symptoms as a screening tool for VWD. We systematically reviewed diagnostic test accuracy results of BATs to screen patients for VWD. We searched Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for eligible studies, reference lists of relevant reviews, registered trials, and relevant conference proceedings. Two investigators screened and abstracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using the revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. We pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review included 7 cohort studies that evaluated the use of BATs to screen adult and pediatric patients for VWD. The pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 75% (95% confidence interval, 66-83) and 54% (29-77), respectively. Certainty of evidence varied from moderate to high. This systematic review provides accuracy estimates for validated BATs as a screening modality for VWD. A BAT is a useful initial screening test to determine who needs specific blood testing.

However, its limitations are that responsiveness was not tested using a negative control group, it was validated only for ovariohysterectomy, and it can be time-consuming. We aimed to evaluate the construct and criterion validity, reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of the UFEPS and its novel short form (SF) in various clinical or painful surgical conditions. Methods Ten client-owned healthy controls (CG) and 40 client-owned cats requiring pain management for clinical or surgical care (20 clinical and 20 surgery group (12 orthopedic and eight soft tissue surgeries) were recruited. Three evaluators assessed pain, in real-time, in clinical cases before and 20 min after rescue analgesia and in surgical cases before and up to 6.5 hours postoperatively, by using the visual analog, numerical ratio, and a simple descriptive scale, in this order, followed by the UFEPS-SF, UFEPS and Glasgow multidimensional feline pain (Glasgow CMPS-Feline) in random order. For the surgical group, rescue analgesia (methadone 0.2 mg/kg IM or IV and/or dipyrone 12.5 mg/kg IV) was performed when the UFEPS-SF score was ≥4 or exceptionally according to clinical judgement. If a third interventional analgesia was required, methadone (0.1–0.2 mg/kg IM) and ketamine (1 mg/kg IM) were administered. For the clinical group, all cats received rescue analgesia (methadone 0.1–0.2 mg/kg IM or IV or nalbuphine 0.5 mg/kg IM or IV), according to the clinician in charge, regardless of pain scores.

Results Reliability ranged between moderate and good for the UFEPS and UFEPS-SF (confidence intervals of intraclass coefficients = 0.73–0.86 and 0.63–0.82 respectively). The Spearman correlation between UFEPS and UFEPS-SF was 0.85, and their correlation with Glasgow CMPS-Feline was strong (0.79 and 0.78 respectively), confirming criterion validity. All scales showed construct validity or responsiveness (higher scores of cats with clinical and postoperative pain vs healthy controls, and the reduction in scores after rescue analgesia).

,,The impact of depression on surgical outcome in Chiari malformation type I: an assessment based on the Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale.,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,2020.0,"OBJECTIVE
The effect of depression on outcomes in Chiari malformation type I (CM-1) is unclear. The authors sought to determine whether depression affects outcome in a surgical cohort of CM-1 patients by using a validated outcome assessment tool, the Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (CCOS).


METHODS
The authors performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of 149 adult CM-1 patients undergoing suboccipital decompression with duraplasty and cranioplasty. Baseline presentation characteristics and composite as well as subcomponent CCOS scores at last follow-up were compared between depressed and nondepressed patients. Outcome comparisons included both a univariable analysis and a logistic regression model adjusting for several covariates.


RESULTS
The prevalence of depression in the study cohort was 28% (41/149). Baseline demographic and imaging characteristics were similar between the 2 patient groups. Dizziness (p = 0.019) and imbalance (p = 0.015) were significantly more common among depressed patients, but clinical symptoms and severity were otherwise comparable. On univariable analysis, depressed patients were significantly less likely to experience improvement in pain symptoms (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.61, p = 0.003) and functionality (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.99, p = 0.049). No significant difference was identified in complications, nonpain symptom improvement, or overall composite CCOS improvement. Similar results were obtained on multivariable analysis controlling for several covariates.


CONCLUSIONS

The methods for assessing HMB are not suited for clinical practice. We analyzed the validity of a combined visual analog scale (VAS) tool assessing the intensity of menstrual bleeding (VASInt) and its impact on activities of daily living (VASImp) to identify women with HMB. Materials and Methods: Analysis conducted in the data set used to validate the Spanish HMB screening tool SAMANTA questionnaire. A logistic regression analysis was used to construct the model. Reference standard was the pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC). The performance of the HMB-VAS and the SAMANTA questionnaire was compared. Correlation with SAMANTA questionnaire, PBAC, and other QoL measurements was assessed. Results: The resulting function (HMB-VAS score = 10.86 × VASInt score +2.48 × VASImp score) showed a slightly lower accuracy versus the SAMANTA questionnaire (86.8% vs. 87.9%) but a similar area under the curve: 0.9396 versus 0.943, respectively (p = 0.6605). The cutoff point was established as 700. After rounding the regression coefficients, the resulting function (11 × VASInt +2 × VASImp) showed 87.6% accuracy. The correlation of HMB-VAS with the SAMANTA questionnaire was strong (r: 0.79819; p < 0.0001), whereas the correlation was moderate to strong with the PBAC (0.59299; p < 0.0001) and weak with the QoL (EuroQoL five dimensions five levels questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L]) and well-being (Psychological General Well-Being Index [PGWBI]) scales (EQ-5D-5L VAS and Index: −0.20332 and −0.24384; PGWBI: −0.21680; p < 0.0001 for both).

,,The surgical anxiety questionnaire (SAQ): development and validation,Psychology & Health,2018.0,"Abstract Objective: Preoperative anxiety is often assessed using general anxiety measures; existing specific measures might lack content coverage and/or are not psychometrically validated. This study aimed to develop a new self-report measure of surgery-specific anxiety and test its psychometric properties. Design: The surgical anxiety questionnaire (SAQ) was developed from themes identified in qualitative research and reviewed by an interdisciplinary expert team. It was administered preoperatively to 135 patients (56% female, mean age 51) on the day of surgery alongside additional measures of preoperative anxiety, state anxiety, perceived stress, depression and social desirability. Follow-up assessment was conducted immediately post-surgery and two weeks post-surgery (n = 114) to examine recovery and predictive validity of the scale. Results: Factor analysis revealed a three component structure, including: concerns about health (six items), concerns about recovery (four items) and concerns about procedures (four items). Three additional items of relatively high concern were retained in the total score (17 items). The SAQ displayed good reliability, validity (content, construct and predictive) and adequate overall psychometric properties. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that the SAQ is a promising tool for measuring preoperative anxiety and predicting recovery.

,,Multicenter validation of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grading scale for acute cholecystitis.,Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery,2020.0,"BACKGROUND
The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) patient assessment committee has created grading systems for emergency general surgery diseases to assist with clinical decision making and risk adjustment during research. Single-institution studies have validated the cholecystitis grading system as associated with patient outcomes. Our aim was to validate the grading system in a multi-institutional fashion and compare it with the Parkland grade and Tokyo Guidelines for acute cholecystitis.


METHODS
Patients presenting with acute cholecystitis to 1 of 8 institutions were enrolled. Discrete data to assign the AAST grade were collected. The Parkland grade was collected prospectively from the operative surgeon from four institutions. Parkland grade, Tokyo Guidelines, AAST grade, and the AAST preoperative grade (clinical and imaging subscales) were compared using linear and logistic regression to the need for surgical ""bailout"" (subtotal or fenestrated cholecystectomy, or cholecystostomy), conversion to open, surgical complications (bile leak, surgical site infection, bile duct injury), all complications, and operative time.


RESULTS
Of 861 patients, 781 underwent cholecystectomy. Mean (SD) age was 51.1 (18.6), and 62.7% were female. There were six deaths. Median AAST grade was 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-2), and median Parkland grade was 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 2-4). Median AAST clinical and imaging grades were 2 (IQR, 2-2) and 1 (IQR, 0-1), respectively. Higher grades were associated with longer operative times, and worse outcomes although few were significant. The Parkland grade outperformed the AAST grade based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.


CONCLUSION
The AAST cholecystitis grading schema has modest discriminatory power similar to the Tokyo Guidelines, but generally lower than the Parkland grade, and should be modified before widespread use.

,,Validation of the Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional (DDT-Pro) With Medical Inpatients and Comparison With the Confusion Assessment Method Algorithm.,The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2020.0,"OBJECTIVE
Delirium remains underdetected as a result of its broad constellation of symptoms and the inadequate neuropsychiatric expertise of most medical-surgical clinicians. Brief, accurate tools are needed to enhance detection.


METHODS
The authors extended validation of the Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional (DDT-Pro), originally validated in a study of inpatients with traumatic brain injury for diagnosis of delirium by nonexpert clinicians, for 200 general medical inpatients in Colombia. The three structured, quantitatively rated items in DDT-Pro represent the three core delirium domains.


RESULTS
High interrater reliability between physician and nurse (0.873) administrators, internal consistency (>0.81), and content validity were found. Compared with independent reference standard diagnosis with DSM-5 or the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (global diagnostic accuracy) range was 93.8%-96.3%. ROC analysis revealed the same cutoff score (≤6) as that for the original study, with somewhat lower sensitivities of 88.0%-90.0% and specificities of 85.3%-81.2% (independent expert physician or nurse ratings). Even when rated by a trained expert physician, the original version of the Confusion Assessment Method algorithm (CAM-A) performed moderately, with lower sensitivities (61.8%-70.0%) than the DDT-Pro (88.0%-100%) and somewhat higher specificities (84.8%-95.3% versus 67.4%-86.7%), with values depending on dementia status, reference standard, and rater type. Accuracies for the DDT-Pro and CAM-A were comparable (DDT-Pro: 83.0%-87.5% versus CAM-A: 87.5%-88.5%), although lower in the dementia subgroup, especially for CAM-A. However, these tools were significantly discordant, especially in negative cases, which suggests that they do not detect diagnosis of patients in the same way.

The DDT-Pro had high validity and reliability in provisional delirium diagnosis by physicians and nonexpert clinicians, although further validation is warranted before widespread use can be recommended.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,5,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,21.0

,,Development and validation of patients’ surgical safety checklist,BMC Health Services Research,2022.0,"Background Poor uptake and understanding of critical perioperative information represent a major safety risk for surgical patients. Implementing a patient-driven surgical safety checklist might enhance the way critical information is given and increase patient involvement in their own safety throughout the surgical pathway. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a Surgical Patient Safety Checklist (PASC) for use by surgical patients. Method This was a prospective study, involving patient representatives, multidisciplinary healthcare professionals and elective surgical patients to develop and validate PASC using consensus-building techniques in two Norwegian hospitals. A set of items intended for PASC were rated by patients and then submitted to Content Validation Index (CVI) analyses. Items of low CVI went through a Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) Hazard Scoring process, as well as a consensus process before they were either kept or discarded. Reliability of patients’ PASC ratings was assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient analysis. Lastly, the face validity of PASC was investigated through focus group interviews with postoperative patients. Results Initial development of PASC resulted in a checklist consisting of two parts, one before (32 items) and one after surgery (26 items). After achieving consensus on the PASC content, 215 surgical patients from six surgical wards rated the items for the CVI analysis on a 1-4 scale and mostly agreed on the content. Five items were removed from the checklist, and six items were redesigned to improve PASCs’ user-friendliness. The total Scale-level index/Average (S-CVI/Ave) before revision was 0.83 and 0.86 for pre- and post-operative PASC items, respectively. Following revision, these increased to 0.86 and 0.93, respectively. The PASC items reliability score was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 0.98). The qualitative assessment identified that patients who used PASC felt more in control of their situation; this was achieved when PASC was given to them at what they felt was the right time and healthcare professionals took part in its usage. Conclusion Multidisciplinary perioperative care staff and surgical patients agreed upon PASC content, the checklist ratings were reliable, and qualitative assessment suggested good face validity. PASC appears to be a usable and valid checklist for elective surgical patients across specialties.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,4,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,18.0
,,Value of the Crowd-Sourced Assessment of Technical Skills (C-SATS) Platform in Surgical Procedures: A Systematic Review of Evidence,Surgical Research,2022.0,"Background: Crowd-Sourced Assessment of Technical Skills (C-SATS) is a surgical data management and learning platform that leverages the knowledge of large expert surgeon and lay groups to assess the technique and technical skills of surgeons in a highly efficient manner. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize published literature on the performance of C-SATS as compared to expert evaluations and assess its use as a training and validation tool in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed per PRISMA guidelines using the Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar databases on published studies that evaluated the use of C-SATS following MIS, such as laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery. Results: A total of 21 reports were included in the review. Twelve studies comparing crowd-sourcing evaluations against expert opinion indicated overall excellent or good correlation with Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS), Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS), and Robotic Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (R-OSATS) scores, with correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman) ranging from 0.69 to 0.95 and reliability index (Cronbach’s alpha) from 0.63 to 0.93 across different specialties and surgical approaches. When using C-SATS to assess performance and validation, assessments positively correlated with traditional methods of time and error-based scoring and global rating scale. Conclusions: Based on the current published literature, the C-SATS platform has been shown to efficiently provide crowd-sourced evaluations that correlate favorably with expert evaluation across a range of surgical specialties and approaches. Use of crowdsourcing has uniformly yielded accurate evaluations of surgeons’ technical skills in a markedly shorter time than expert reviews. C-SATS may be a cost-effective complement or alternative to traditional models of evaluating surgical proficiency.

,,A dedicated paediatric logistic organ dysfunction score - adjusted pressure injury risk assessment scale is required for tertiary paediatric ICUs,Cardiology in the Young,2019.0,"We read Kulik et al’s article on “Pressure injury prevention for paediatric cardiac surgical patients using a standardized clinical tool” with interest. They have highlighted the significant variation in pressure injury susceptibility that exists between hospital units, thereby emphasising the importance of integrating a dedicated evidence-based guideline into a nurse-driven pressure injury prevention programme in children with CHD. Our pressure injury management strategy aligns with this principle and has been recently implemented in our mixed tertiary paediatric ICU. Critically ill children admitted to the paediatric ICU are at high risk for developing pressure injuries. Of the three pressure injury risk assessment scales validated in the paediatric intensive care setting, the Glamorgan Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment Scale is the only tool developed specifically for the paediatric population. However, pressure injury risk assessment scales are used universally in hospitals and do not adjust for acuity of illness. Our paediatric ICU has recorded higher internal numbers of pressure injuries than other areas of our hospital. The significant financial penalty attracted by each pressure injury, together with a clear need for review of our clinical practice, prompted this study. As part of a quality improvement initiative, we studied predictors for identifying patients at high risk of pressure injury and implemented measures to prevent the occurrence of pressure injuries. Pressure injury incidence data were obtained from the Queensland Children's Hospital Paediatric ICU pressure injury audit for the period between 1 July, 2017 and 31 December, 2017. This database includes both general and cardiac patients. Glamorgan and Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 scores correlation values were obtained from Metavision, the electronic medical record system used in our paediatric ICU. The statistical program “R” was used to analyse these data. A nonlinear regression line was used to best display the correlation between Glamorgan and Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 scores. For the 98 pressure injuries recorded, we demonstrated a positive correlation between the two scores (Fig 1). As pressure injury risk assessment scales are not suitable for universal use across all hospital departments, we propose that a modification of the Glamorgan risk assessment scale could provide a more representative comparison across hospital departments.

This study aims to create a synthetic laryngeal microsurgery simulation model and training program; to assess its face, content, and construct validity; and to review the available phonomicrosurgery simulation models in the literature.


STUDY DESIGN
Nonrandomly assigned control study.


SETTING
Simulation training course for the otolaryngology residency program at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.


METHODS
Resident (postgraduate year 1 [PGY1]/PGY2) and expert groups were recruited. A laryngeal microsurgery synthetic model was developed. Nine tasks were designed and assessed through a set of programmed exercises with increasing difficulty, to fulfill 5 surgical competencies. Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device sensors applied to the participants' hands measured time and movements. The activities were video-recorded and blindly assessed by 2 laryngologists using a specific and global rating scale (SRS and GRS). A 5-point Likert survey assessing validity was completed by experts.


RESULTS
Eighteen participants were recruited (14 residents and 4 experts). Experts performed significantly better than residents in the SRS (p = .003), and GRS (p = .004). Internal consistency was demonstrated for the SRS (α = .972, p < .001). Experts had a shorter execution time (p = .007), and path length with the right hand (p = .04). The left hand did not show significant differences. The survey assessing validity resulted in a median 36 out of 40 points score for face validity; and 43 out of 45 points score, for global content validity.

,,Ex Vivo and In Vivo Evaluation of Fibrinogen Concentrate to Mitigate Post-Surgical Bleeding in Neonates,Blood,2021.0,"
 Introduction: Bleeding is a serious complication among neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and it is linked to significant morbidity and mortality. Current standard of care treatment for bleeding after CPB focuses on the transfusion of adult blood products, including platelets and cryoprecipitate. However, prior work by Nellenbach et al. has demonstrated structural differences between neonatal and adult clotting components. Importantly, neonatal and adult fibrin do not fully integrate during clot formation which may contribute to ineffective clot formation and/or increased thrombotic risk following transfusion of adult cryoprecipitate to neonates. There has been increased interest in using human fibrinogen concentrate (HFC) in treating bleeding in the post-CPB neonate; however, HFC has not been validated in this population through evidence-based means. This study analyzed structural and degradation properties of post-CPB clots +/- the ex vivo addition of HFC and compared structural and degradation properties of post-CPB clots after the in vivo transfusion of HFC versus cryoprecipitate.
 Methods: Human neonatal plasma samples were collected from patients undergoing CPB at the Children's Hospital of Atlanta. For ex vivo studies, samples were taken at baseline, post-bypass, and post-transfusion of cryoprecipitate (n = 18 patients). Clots were formed for analysis from samples alone as well as post-bypass samples with the addition of 0.5 or 0.9 mg/mL HFC (RiaSTAP, CSL Behring) and structure was examined through confocal microscopy. Clot degradation was assessed through a microfluidic fibrinolysis assay. For in vivo studies, samples were taken at baseline, post-transfusion of cryoprecipitate or HFC, upon ICU arrival, and at 24 hours post-surgery (n = 36 patients). Clots were formed from samples and structure was examined through confocal microscopy. Clot degradation was assessed through a plate-based fibrinolysis assay.
 Results: In ex vivo studies, clot structural analysis demonstrated no significant differences in fiber density between samples collected at different time points (baseline = 0.541 ± 0.105, post-bypass = 0.431 ± 0.111, post-transfusion = 0.594 ± 0.170). The addition of 0.5 mg/mL or 0.9 mg/mL HFC to post-bypass samples led to a significant increase in fiber density (0.5 mg/mL HFC=0.654 ± 0.158, p=0.02; 0.9 mg/mL HFC= 0.797 ± 0.193, p<0.0001). Functional microfluidic analysis of clot degradation demonstrated significantly faster degradation times among post-bypass samples when compared to baseline samples (baseline degradation rate = 11.061 ± 6.087, post-bypass degradation rate = 25.906 ± 9.990 microns/hour, p=0.04). The addition of 0.5 mg/mL HFC resulted in a slower degradation rate from the original post-CPB degradation rate, but did not reach statistical significance (0.5 mg/mL HFC=14.091 ± 2.241, p=0.14). However, the addition of 0.9 mg/mL HFC resulted in a significantly slower degradation rate (0.9 mg/mL HFC=8.594 ± 6.087, p=0.01). Studies comparing in vivo transfusion of cryoprecipitate and HFC demonstrated no significant difference between treatment groups in clot density or degradation rate for any sample time point.
 Conclusion: We identify patterns in structural properties of clots formed after the transfusion of HFC that are consistent with successful hemostasis. However, caution is warranted regarding potentially thrombotic risks and should be carefully analyzed in future studies.

,,Validation of Training and Acquisition of Surgical Skills in Veterinary Laparoscopic Surgery: A Review,Frontiers in Veterinary Science,2020.0,"At present, veterinary laparoscopic surgery training is lacking in experiences that provide a controlled and safe environment where surgeons can practice specific techniques while receiving experts' feedback. Surgical skills acquired using simulators must be certified and transferable to the operating room. Most models for practicing laparoscopic skills in veterinary minimally invasive surgery are general task trainers and consist of boxes (simulators) designed for training human surgery. These simulators exhibit several limitations, including anatomic species and procedural differences, as well as general psychomotor training rather than in vivo skill recreation. In this paper, we review the existing methods of training, evaluation, and validation of technical skills in veterinary laparoscopic surgery. Content includes global and specific scales, and the conditions a structured curriculum should meet for improving the performance of novice surgeons during and after training. A focus on trainee-specific assessment and tailored-technical instruction should influence training programs. We provide a comprehensive analysis of current theories and concepts related to the evaluation and validation of simulators for training laparoscopic surgery in small animal surgery.

,,Retrieval Augmented Generation for the Detection of Major Bleeding Events in the Electronic Health Record,Blood,2024.0,"
 
 Background: Non-Surgical Major Bleeding (NSMB) is an important clinical event associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Detecting NSMB events in the electronic health record is central to conducting research and quality assessment studies for patients on anticoagulation therapy and in other settings as well. Determining a patient's NSMB history by means of manual clinical chart review is limited by time and human resources concerns. Natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a promising modality for the detection of clinical events in the electronic health record. Transformer NLP models have revolutionized the field and have performed satisfactorily for varied clinical endpoints, including venous thromboembolism for which this approach has been extensively validated. However, there is a lack of data concerning the use of NLP to detect bleeding events. Training such models generally requires an arbitrarily large, annotated dataset, which necessitates significant amounts of human labor. The use of generative large language models (LLM's) with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is emerging as a promising modality to generate machine-derived labels without a large human-annotated set. RAG seeks to avoid hallucinations and incomplete knowledge in LLM's by providing domain-specific context from external sources. We hypothesized RAG could be used to detect NSMB events in cancer patients.
 Methods: Clinical notes for 174 patients seen at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were assessed manually for NSMB using the CEDARS+PINES NLP platform (Mantha et al, 2024). The definition of NSMB was derived from the formulation of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Schulman et al, 2005) and optimized for use within a generative LLM prompt. Clinical notes were processed into chunks of 250 characters and vector encoded with the gte-large-en-v1.5 embedding model for retrieval (Li et al, 2023). The vectors for the clinical notes were stored in a Chroma vector database. The ISTH definition of NSMB was split into three components, and for each patient, the top 20 relevant chunks pertaining to each component were retrieved via vector similarity search. These chunks were further subset with a reranking model to optimize their relevance to NSMB. Finally, they were formatted into a prompt template, which was used as input to the Llama3 8B LLM (Meta Inc, 2024). To leverage the Chain-of-Thought prompting technique which elicits reasoning in LLM's, the prompt template included the ISTH definition of NSMB and step-by-step instructions for determining if a patient had NSMB. For a given patient, the LLM outputs a binary label (NSMB detected or no evidence of NSMB) and its rationale.
 Results: 3,676 notes for 174 patients at MSKCC were processed with the RAG pipeline. We optimized model performance by tuning several hyperparameters. Hyperparameter options included chunk size of 250 or 500, LLM prompt strategy, reranking with a cross encoder or LLM, and LLM model choice. The final RAG pipeline used the following configuration: chunk size of 250, Llama 3 8B as the LLM and reranking model, and in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought prompting. We noted that the performance of RAG was highly sensitive to the hyperparameter choices. With a 14% prevalence of NSMB in our dataset, the model achieved a precision of 72% and recall of 72%. Our model was computationally efficient, processing all 174 samples in ~15 minutes.
 Conclusions: These results highlight the potential of LLM's with RAG for the detection of NSMB in electronic health records. Such an approach could be used to augment or even replace manual chart annotation in clinical research and quality assessment studies without the need for large, human-annotated training datasets. Further refinement of these models to optimize their precision, recall, and clinical utility is warranted.

,,Aesthetic Evaluation of Facial Scars in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Basal Cell Carcinoma: A Prospective Longitudinal Pilot Study and Validation of POSAS 2.0 in the Lithuanian Language,Cancers,2024.0,"Simple Summary The quality of life of patients with facial basal cell carcinoma significantly improves after surgery. Nevertheless, it remains inferior to those without the disease. Facial scarring has been identified as a contributing factor to adverse psychosocial changes. In this study, we explore the aesthetic assessment of facial scars within this specific patient group, aiming to uncover potential correlations between the severity of scars and the quality of life. This study comprises two phases as follows: scale validation and pilot with a sample size of 100 patients. The Lithuanian version of the POSAS 2.0 was established after a thorough psychometric evaluation, surpassing acceptable validity thresholds. The pilot phase findings show a notable improvement in scars during the later stages of postoperative recovery, with the initial identification of specific groups that perceive their scars more negatively. Given the observed correlations between the scar assessment and the quality of life, this study highlights the crucial role of addressing the aesthetic satisfaction of patients with surgically treated basal cell carcinoma. Abstract Facial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) surgery enhances the quality of life (QoL) but leaves patients with inferior QoL, presumably caused by scarring, emphasizing the need to understand post-surgery aesthetic satisfaction. This study aimed to validate the Lithuanian version of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) 2.0 and utilise it to identify scar evaluation differences and correlations among POSAS scores and specific aesthetic facial regions, age, gender, surgery types, and short- and long-term QoL. Employing a prospective longitudinal design, 100 patients with facial scars after surgical BCC removal were enrolled. The validation phase confirmed the translated POSAS 2.0 psychometric properties, while the pilot phase used statistical analyses to compare scores among demographic and clinical groups and evaluate correlations between scar assessment and QoL. The findings indicate that the translated Lithuanian version of POSAS 2.0 exhibits good psychometric properties, revealing insights into aesthetic satisfaction with post-surgical facial scars and their impact on QoL. The Lithuanian version of the POSAS 2.0 was established as a valid instrument for measuring post-surgical linear scars. QoL with scar assessment statistically significantly correlates, 6 months after surgery, with worse scores, particularly notable among women, younger patients, and those with tumours in the cheek region.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,15.0
,,The SPOT GRADE: A New Method for Reproducibly Quantifying Surgical Wound Bleeding,SPINE,2017.0,"Study Design. Benchtop model with prospective surgeon video testing. Objective. To create a surface bleeding severity scale, the SPOT GRADE (SG), for quantitative assessment of target bleeding site (TBS) blood loss. This is of particular interest for spinal surgery due to epidural bleeding and an inability to use diathermy and radiofrequency cautery close to nerve roots. Summary of Background Data. A novel apparatus perfusable at known flow rates and simulating different sized wounds was used to create movies to educate surgeons on specific degrees of bleeding. Methods. Training (36) and testing (108) videos were created using a benchtop apparatus employing different bleeding severities based on the six-level SG (none, minimal, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme) and TBS sizes (1, 10, and 50 cm2). Fourteen surgeons in four specialties (cardiothoracic, abdominal, spine, and orthopedic lower extremity) were trained and tested to evaluate SG characteristics including inter-rater and intrarater reliability. Results. The interclass correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.89840 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85771, 1), whereas the intraclass correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.93673 (95% CI: 0.89603, 1). In 98% of cases (95% CI: 0.9736, 0.9927), surgeons correctly identified eligible bleeds for a future clinical trial (scores = 1, 2, or 3) and in 91% of cases (95% CI: 0.8895, 0.9344), surgeons correctly identified noneligible bleeds (scores = 4 or 5). In 98.6% of cases (95% CI: 0.9777, 0.9945), physicians correctly identified true hemostasis (score = 0). Based upon these data the probability of a physician rating a bleed incorrectly as hemostasis (score = 0) is estimated to be 1.51% (95% CI: 0.0061, 0.0363). Conclusion. This SG is reproducible and reliable providing a basis for educating surgeons on TBS blood loss. It appears to be a new standard for evaluating wound blood loss.

,,Validation of A 3D-printed simulator for training in endoscopic injection of bulking agent for vesicoureteral reflux: a pilot study,Surgical Endoscopy,2024.0,"Background Simulation-based training plays a significant role in surgical education, especially in minimally invasive pediatric surgery and urology. This study aimed to evaluate a novel 3D-printed model as training tool for endoscopic injection of bulking agent. Methods Forty-three attendees and ten teaching faculty members were invited to complete a post hoc questionnaire after completing training sessions using the Fish Tank Simulation Model (FTSM). The survey consisted of a 7-question 5-point Likert scale to assess the model’s realism (face validity) and its effectiveness as training tool (content validity). Results Regarding the training status, 20/53 (37.7%) participants were fellow and/or specialist in pediatric surgery and 33/53 (62.3%) were surgeons in training. Their level of confidence in endoscopic injection procedure was defined as novice (< 10 procedures per year) in 33/53 (62.3%), intermediate (10–20 procedures per year) in 10/53 (18.9%), and expert (> 20 procedures per year) in 10/53 (18.9%). Regarding both face validity and content validity assessments, no statistically significant differences were found between scores given by novice vs intermediate/expert groups. Similarly, no statistically significant differences emerged between scores given by participant vs faculty groups assessing the content validity of the FTSM. The FTSM was considered a good teaching tool for beginners by 44/53 (83%) and for pediatric surgeons/urologists by 38/53 (71.7%). Conclusions The 3D-printed Fish Tank Simulation Model proved to be a valuable, high-fidelity, easily accessible, cost-effective, hygienic, and domestic-use training tool for pediatric surgeons/urologists conducting the procedure. The model’s user-friendly design and realistic environment enhanced learning opportunities for trainees, regardless of their experience level or training status. Nevertheless, further development is necessary, particularly in enhancing the realism of the ureteral hiatus and reproducing more complex anatomy, to make it beneficial for the training of advanced surgeons.

The purpose of this study is to rigorously examine and validate the VF-14 scale on a Greek population of ophthalmic patients employing Rasch measurement techniques. Two cohorts of patients were sampled in two waves. The first cohort included 150 cataract patients and the second 150 patients with other ophthalmic diseases. The patients were sampled first while pending surgical or other corrective therapy and two months after receiving therapy. The original 14-item VF-14 demonstrated poor measurement precision and disordered response category thresholds. A revised eight-item version, the VF-8G (‘G’ for ‘Greek’), was tested and confirmed for validity in the cataract research population. No differential functioning was reported for gender, age, and underlying disorder. Improvement in the revised scale correlated with improvement in the mental and physical component of the general health scale SF-36.

,,Development and validation of a virtual teaching method for minimally invasive surgery skills: a prospective cohort study,"International Journal of Surgery (London, England)",2024.0,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in operative exposure for surgical trainees, necessitating alternative training methods to mitigate the impact on surgical education. This study sought to evaluate whether minimally invasive surgery (MIS) skills could be taught remotely using widely available technology with objective assessments of proficiency. Methods: This was a pilot observational study with a comparative assessment of face-to-face (F2F) and virtual training of novice learners in MIS skills. Performance and objective cognitive workload parameters [Surgical Task Load Index (SURG-TLX) score, heart rate, and pupil metrics] were evaluated. The assessments were peg transfer [McGill Inanimate System for Training and Evaluation of Laparoscopic Skills (MISTELS)] and suturing [Suturing Training and Testing (SUTT)] tasks performed using box trainers. Virtual teaching was conducted by expert trainers using a web-based streaming platform. Results: Technical challenges of delivering a virtual MIS skills course were addressed after a pilot course. Participants (n=20) in the final course had similar baseline characteristics and were randomly allocated to F2F (n=8) and virtual (n=12) teaching groups. Participants in the online group completed the peg transfer task faster than the F2F group (11.25 min vs. 16.88 min; P=0.015). There were no significant differences in all other MISTELS and SUTT performance measures between groups. Cognitive workload parameters (SURG-TLX score, heart rate, and pupil metrics) were also similar between groups. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that virtual teaching of MIS skills using a web-based streaming platform is feasible and effective, providing the foundation for low-cost, effective, and scalable MIS skills programs in the future.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,9.0
,,Development and validation of a quality of life measurement scale specific to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: the QoL-HHT,Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases,2022.0,"Background Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) disease is a rare genetic disorder with symptoms and complications that can significantly affect patients’ daily lives. To date, no scale has been validated to assess the specific symptoms of this disease on the quality of life (QOL) of HHT patients. This makes it difficult for clinicians to accurately measure the quality of life of patients with HHT. The present study aims to develop and validate a QOL measurement tool specific to HHT disease: the QOL questionnaire in HHT (QoL-HHT). Methods A quantitative, non-interventional, multi-center study involving HHT patients in twenty French HHT expert centers was conducted. A calibration sample of 415 HHT patients and a validation sample of 228 HHT patients voluntarily participated in the study. Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) analyses, reliability analyses, and correlational analyses. Results The EFA, CFA and ESEM results allowed us to provide evidence of the factorial structure of a questionnaire composed of 24 items measuring 6 domains of QOL: Physical limitations, social relationships, concern about bleeding, relationship with the medical profession, experience of symptoms, and concern about the evolution of the disease. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients (> 0.70) demonstrated reliable internal consistency of all the QoL-HHT scores (dimensions). The results of the test–retest provided further evidence of the reliability of the QOL-HHT scores over time. Correlational analyses provided evidence for the convergent validity of the QoL-HHT scores. Conclusions We developed a simple and quick self-assessment tool to measure quality of life specific to HHT disease. This study demonstrated reliability and validity of our QoL-HHT scores. It is a very promising tool to evaluate the impact of HHT disease on all aspects of the quality of life of HHT patients in order to offer them individualized medico-psycho-social support.

,,Validation of the Menopause Transition Scale (MTS),Menopause,2022.0,"Abstract Objective All women will experience menopause transition, and a majority will experience symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life. Current validated menopause symptom scales are time consuming, phrased in clinical language, and difficult to adopt for digital use. This study seeks to validate a short novel survey which can be reliably completed without coaching and accurately represents the experience of the menopause transition. Methods We developed a patient-centric questionnaire (Menopause Transition Scale, MTS) to examine for symptoms of menopause. Survey responders represented a total of 144 women with at least one symptom of menopause. Survey responders included women affected by cancer aged 30 to 65 (n = 72) and women not affected by cancer aged 45 to 60 (n = 72). Cronbach Alpha was used to examine for internal consistency and dimensionality was assessed using exploratory factor analysis. The cross-validation was analyzed against established patient scales using Spearman correlations or Chi-Square analysis, as appropriate. Results The MTS questions showed internal consistency with a Cronbach Alpha of 0.63. The individual questions loaded into three unique domains. The MTS overall correlated with validated scales for menopause symptoms, the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (r = –0.86, P < 0.0001) and Greene Climacteric Scale (r = –0.65, P < 0.0001). Libido correlated with scales (P = 0.0150) and subscales (r = –0.70, P < 0.0001) relating low sexual desire. Energy (r = –0.62, P < 0.0001), Mood (r = –0.48, P < 0.0001), and Hot Flashes/Night Sweats (r = –0.77, P < 0.0001) correlated with scales and subscales related to mood, depression, and vasomotor symptoms. The majority of our responders expressed mild vaginal bleeding. The highest frequency of severe symptoms were low libido and poor energy. Conclusions The MTS is a short thorough patient-centric survey that is readily amenable to digital adoption to measure symptoms of menopause as women transition in the out-patient setting. Further study is needed for the longitudinal assessment of symptoms through the transition process and the response of women to therapeutic options.

,,Surgical resident experience with common bile duct exploration and assessment of performance and autonomy with formative feedback,World Journal of Emergency Surgery : WJES,2023.0,"Background Common bile duct exploration (CBDE) is safe and effective for managing choledocholithiasis, but most US general surgeons have limited experience with CBDE and are uncomfortable performing this procedure in practice. Surgical trainee exposure to CBDE is limited, and their learning curve for achieving autonomous, practice-ready performance has not been previously described. This study tests the hypothesis that receipt of one or more prior CBDE operative performance assessments, combined with formative feedback, is associated with greater resident operative performance and autonomy. Methods Resident and attending assessments of resident operative performance and autonomy were obtained for 189 laparoscopic or open CBDEs performed at 28 institutions. Performance and autonomy were graded along validated ordinal scales. Cases in which the resident had one or more prior CBDE case evaluations ( n  = 48) were compared with cases in which the resident had no prior evaluations ( n  = 141). Results Compared with cases in which the resident had no prior CBDE case evaluations, cases with a prior evaluation had greater proportions of practice-ready or exceptional performance ratings according to both residents (27% vs. 11%, p  = .009) and attendings (58% vs. 19%, p  < .001) and had greater proportions of passive help or supervision only autonomy ratings according to both residents (17% vs. 4%, p  = .009) and attendings (69% vs. 32%, p  < .01). Conclusions Residents with at least one prior CBDE evaluation and formative feedback demonstrated better operative performance and received greater autonomy than residents without prior evaluations, underscoring the propensity of feedback to help residents achieve autonomous, practice-ready performance for rare operations.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0
,,"The Bariatric Interprofessional Psychosocial Assessment of Suitability Scale predicts binge eating, quality of life and weight regain following bariatric surgery",Clinical Obesity,2020.0,"Presurgical psychosocial evaluations are an important component of bariatric care; yet, bariatric programs vary widely in their assessment and interpretation of psychosocial risk. There is a need for validated clinical tools that help to standardize and streamline the assessment of variables relevant to surgical outcomes. The present study contributes to the validation of the Bariatric Interprofessional Psychosocial Assessment of Suitability Scale (BIPASS), a novel presurgical psychosocial evaluation tool, by: (a) examining the psychometric properties and optimal cutoff score, and; (b) examining the ability of the BIPASS tool to predict outcomes 1 and 2 years postsurgery, including weight regain, quality of life, psychiatric symptoms and adherence to postsurgical follow‐up appointments. The BIPASS was applied retrospectively to the charts of 179 consecutively referred patients to a metropolitan bariatric surgery programme. Internal consistency for the BIPASS was acceptable, and interrater reliability was excellent. Higher BIPASS scores predicted higher binge eating symptomatology and lower mental health‐related quality of life at 1 year postsurgery, and weight regain at 2 years (all P < .01). The BIPASS did not predict adherence to postsurgical follow‐up appointments. Findings suggest that the BIPASS can be used to identify patients at increased risk of disordered eating, poor quality of life and weight regain early in the postsurgical course, thereby facilitating patient education and appropriate interventions.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,12.0
,,Assessment of surgical capacity and productivity in high-volume Ethiopian hospitals: mixed method study,BMC Health Services Research,2025.0,"Background In Ethiopia and other low-and middle-income countries, access to emergency and elective surgical care is still inadequate and inequitable. Ethiopia has initiated a nationwide strategic plan aimed at tackling obstacles within the surgical system. The aim of this study was to assess surgical and anesthesia care capacity and productivity in high volume Ethiopian hospitals. Methods An explanatory mixed-methods study was conducted in 24 high-volume public hospitals across Ethiopia’s 10 regions and 2 city administrations. Data were collected through structured document reviews, site observations, and interviews using a validated WHO-aligned tool. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS, and qualitative responses were thematically analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Results Addis Ababa hosts over 60% of the national surgical workforce, highlighting stark regional disparities. While 80% of hospitals reported adequate infrastructure, site observations revealed functional inconsistencies in PACU design, sterilization units, and equipment availability. Only 77% of hospitals consistently implemented patient monitoring and handover protocols. Surgical productivity was low, with an average of 2.5 surgeries per week per clinician and 52.39% annual workforce productivity. Best practices included the use of EMRs, backlog-reduction campaigns, and daily interdisciplinary briefings. However, persistent challenges included inadequate staffing, poor infrastructure, and uneven adoption of safety protocols. Conclusion and recommendation Ethiopia’s surgical system shows promising innovations in select hospitals, yet national scale-up is hindered by infrastructure gaps, uneven workforce distribution, and inconsistent safety practices. Addressing these challenges requires data-driven planning, targeted investment in underserved regions, and expanded use of digital systems and collaborative networks to promote best practice adoption across facilities.

,,“Validation of Artificial Intelligence Severity Assessment in Metopic Craniosynostosis”,The Cleft Palate Craniofacial Journal,2021.0,"Objective Several severity metrics have been developed for metopic craniosynostosis, including a recent machine learning-derived algorithm. This study assessed the diagnostic concordance between machine learning and previously published severity indices. Design Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans of patients who underwent surgical correction of metopic craniosynostosis were quantitatively analyzed for severity. Each scan was manually measured to derive manual severity scores and also received a scaled metopic severity score (MSS) assigned by the machine learning algorithm. Regression analysis was used to correlate manually captured measurements to MSS. ROC analysis was performed for each severity metric and were compared to how accurately they distinguished cases of metopic synostosis from controls. Results In total, 194 CT scans were analyzed, 167 with metopic synostosis and 27 controls. The mean scaled MSS for the patients with metopic was 6.18 ± 2.53 compared to 0.60 ± 1.25 for controls. Multivariable regression analyses yielded an R-square of 0.66, with significant manual measurements of endocranial bifrontal angle (EBA) (P = 0.023), posterior angle of the anterior cranial fossa (p < 0.001), temporal depression angle (P = 0.042), age (P < 0.001), biparietal distance (P < 0.001), interdacryon distance (P = 0.033), and orbital width (P < 0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated a high diagnostic value of the MSS (AUC = 0.96, P < 0.001), which was comparable to other validated indices including the adjusted EBA (AUC = 0.98), EBA (AUC = 0.97), and biparietal/bitemporal ratio (AUC = 0.95).

,,Cross‐cultural adaptation and psychometric validation of the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire to the Spanish language in head and neck surgery,International Wound Journal,2019.0,"External appearance is the main aesthetic outcome in patients who undergo surgical procedures. Scars located in exposed areas, such as the neck and face, are important for patients. There are at least eight instruments that are used to evaluate postoperative scars, but few fulfil standard methodological conditions. The Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ) was designed and validated using psychometric methodology. However, this scale has not been translated or validated in the Spanish language. The aim of this study was to undergo a cross‐cultural adaptation and psychometric validation of the PSAQ scale to the Spanish language in patients who underwent head and neck surgery. We followed The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines for the translation and validation of health‐related scales. Forward and back translations were made by independent translators. We included adult patients who underwent thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, parotidectomy, and neck dissection. For the psychometric validation, we used a principal axis exploratory factor analysis with oblimin rotation. A reliability test involving Cronbachs alpha and the item‐total correlation was performed and for the convergent/concurrent validity, we selected the Spanish version of the Vancouver Scar Scale. A total of 180 patients were recruited. Factor analysis showed a five‐factor solution. Cronbachs alpha for the subscales was >0.7.

They are based on the following: (1) formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic [Medline search]; (2) American College of Physicians Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Guidelines1; (3) guideline policies, including the AASLD Policy on the Development and Use of Practice Guidelines and the AGA Policy Statement on Guidelines2; (4) the experience of the authors in the specified topic. Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information. In an attempt to characterize the quality of evidence supporting recommendations, the Practice Guidelines Committee of the AASLD requires a category to be assigned and reported with each recommendation (Table 1).3 These recommendations are fully endorsed by the AASLD and the American Society of Transplantation. AASLD, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases; MELD, model for end-stage liver disease; PBC, primary biliary cirrhosis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; CTP, Child-Turcotte-Pugh; PELD, pediatric end-stage liver disease; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; HPS, hepatopulmonary syndrome; NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Liver transplantation has had a profound impact on the care of patients with end-stage liver disease and is the most effective treatment for many patients with acute or chronic liver failure resulting from a variety of causes. Before transplantation, patients with advanced liver disease usually died within months to years. These patients now have the opportunity for extended survival with excellent quality of life after liver transplantation.4 Furthermore, the costs of liver transplants have steadily declined in recent years.5 Most liver transplants are performed using a whole liver from a deceased donor. During transplantation, the donor liver is placed in the orthotopic position, hence the term orthotopic liver transplantation. However, because of the unique anatomical organization of the liver, donor organs can be divided and the separate parts transplanted into two recipients (split liver transplantation).6 Using this technique, a portion of the left lobe of an adult donor organ can be transplanted into a child and the remaining portion used to transplant the liver into an adult.7-10 Under ideal circumstances, a deceased donor organ also can be split and transplanted into two adult recipients.10 The same surgical techniques can be used to facilitate transplantation using living donors, where only a portion of the donor liver is removed for transplantation. Living donor transplantation for children, using a portion of the left lobe, is a well-established procedure.7, 8 Living donor transplantation for adults, in which the donor right lobe typically is transplanted, also is performed at many transplant centers, although donor safety remains an ongoing concern.11, 12 Perioperative complications typically are higher with these various techniques; however, long-term patient survival seems comparable with that of deceased whole liver transplantation.10, 13 Liver transplantation is a complex, time-consuming operation that requires vascular reconstruction of the hepatic artery, the portal vein, and the hepatic venous drainage to the inferior vena cava. Biliary reconstruction usually is accomplished using an end-to-end anastomosis of the proximal donor bile duct to the distal recipient duct; however, in recipients with diseased ducts, the donor duct is usually anastomosed to the jejunum using a Roux-en-Y loop. A number of complications can be anticipated after liver transplantation, including perioperative and surgical complications, immunologic and infectious disorders, and a variety of medical complications. The outcome of all patients who receive liver transplants in the United States and Europe is continuously tracked in comprehensive databases: the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the European Transplant Registry (ELTR), respectively. Using outcomes from these databases, computer models are available to address specific issues of organ allocation and to track the efficacy of cadaveric and living-related transplants both nationally and at individual centers.14 The dramatic increase in transplants over the past two decades seems to have had a favorable impact on chronic liver disease mortality in the United States.15 Nevertheless, many issues remain, including specific indications and contraindications to liver transplantation, the optimum timing of the operation, and the most appropriate use of scarce donor organs. Liver transplantation is indicated for acute or chronic liver failure from any cause. The major conditions that lead to the need for transplantation in adults and children are summarized in Table 2. The first step in considering a patient for potential liver transplantation is determining the need for the operation. The second step is to confirm that all other effective treatments have been attempted. Finally, the patient's likelihood of being an appropriate candidate for transplantation should be carefully assessed by a transplantation center. The natural history of the patient's disease must be carefully compared with the anticipated survival after liver transplantation. The clinical tools most widely used to determine prognosis in patients with chronic liver diseases include disease-specific indices for primary biliary cirrhosis and sclerosing cholangitis, the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification, the prognostic model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), as well as the impact of specific complications of cirrhosis on patient survival. The Mayo Clinic prognostic model for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is the best-validated tool for determining prognosis in groups of patients with chronic liver disease.16, 17 However, this model is useful only for patients with PBC. A number of disease-specific models also have been developed for determining the prognosis of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).18 However, in addition to being useful only for patients with this disease, it is not clear whether any of the PSC models add to simple means of assessing prognosis, such as the CTP classification.19 The CTP classification, which was designed to stratify the risk of portacaval shunt surgery in patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding, has gained favor over the past decade as a simple method for determining the prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease (Table 3).20, 21 Although never formally validated as",OpenAlex,0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,1.5
,10.1053/jhep.2001.22172,A Model to Predict Survival in Patients With End–Stage Liver Disease,Hepatology,2001.0,"A recent mandate emphasizes severity of liver disease to determine priorities in allocating organs for liver transplantation and necessitates a disease severity index based on generalizable, verifiable, and easily obtained variables. The aim of the study was to examine the generalizability of a model previously created to estimate survival of patients undergoing the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure in patient groups with a broader range of disease severity and etiology. The Model for End–Stage Liver Disease (MELD) consists of serum bilirubin and creatinine levels, International Normalized Ratio (INR) for prothrombin time, and etiology of liver disease. The model's validity was tested in 4 independent data sets, including (1) patients hospitalized for hepatic decompensation (referred to as “hospitalized” patients), (2) ambulatory patients with noncholestatic cirrhosis, (3) patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and (4) unselected patients from the 1980s with cirrhosis (referred to as “historical” patients). In these patients, the model's ability to classify patients according to their risk of death was examined using the concordance (c)–statistic. The MELD scale performed well in predicting death within 3 months with a c–statistic of (1) 0.87 for hospitalized patients, (2) 0.80 for noncholestatic ambulatory patients, (3) 0.87 for PBC patients, and (4) 0.78 for historical cirrhotic patients. Individual complications of portal hypertension had minimal impact on the model's prediction (range of improvement in c–statistic: &lt;.01 for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and variceal hemorrhage to ascites: 0.01–0.03). The MELD scale is a reliable measure of mortality risk in patients with end–stage liver disease and suitable for use as a disease severity index to determine organ allocation priorities.",OpenAlex,0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,1.5

The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators responsible for the care of acute ischemic stroke patients within the first 48 hours from stroke onset. These guidelines supersede the prior 2007 guidelines and 2009 updates. Methods— Members of the writing committee were appointed by the American Stroke Association Stroke Council’s Scientific Statement Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Strict adherence to the American Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained throughout the consensus process. Panel members were assigned topics relevant to their areas of expertise, reviewed the stroke literature with emphasis on publications since the prior guidelines, and drafted recommendations in accordance with the American Heart Association Stroke Council’s Level of Evidence grading algorithm. Results— The goal of these guidelines is to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with stroke. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care and detail aspects of stroke care from patient recognition; emergency medical services activation, transport, and triage; through the initial hours in the emergency department and stroke unit. The guideline discusses early stroke evaluation and general medical care, as well as ischemic stroke, specific interventions such as reperfusion strategies, and general physiological optimization for cerebral resuscitation. Conclusions— Because many of the recommendations are based on limited data, additional research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke remains urgently needed.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

,10.1097/ta.0000000000000793,Clinical assessment of trauma-induced coagulopathy and its contribution to postinjury mortality,Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery,2015.0,"The concept of impaired coagulation following injury has been the subject of scientific investigation for a century,1 but defining the responsible mechanisms to guide precision-evidence management for distinct phenotypes remains elusive. In 2010, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recognizing the ongoing knowledge gaps in the diagnosis and management of coagulopathy associated with severe injury, organized a workshop and arrived at a consensus to name this phenomenon trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC). The common denominator of TIC-related research has been a laboratory-based strategy for quantifying and stratifying TIC. While detailed analyses of laboratory data related to TIC have been correlated with outcomes, there is a spectrum of coagulopathic phenotypes, and investigative efforts have been limited by the lack of (1) a standardized clinical scoring system for coagulopathy and (2) criteria for determining whether coagulopathy impacted postinjury mortality, that is, are they dying because they are bleeding or bleeding because they are dying.2 Rather remarkably, resuscitation strategies have emerged to treat a condition that remains a vague clinical entity that is presently defined by subjective surgeon assessment and blood product/transfusion requirements. Although clinical scoring systems for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in sepsis exist,3 to date, no consensus statement regarding the clinical presentation of TIC has emerged. Standardized scoring systems for key clinical definitions, which can be quantified, validated, and tested for interrater reliability, are critical to progress in challenging clinical entities. As an example, there was little progress in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of multiple-organ failure (MOF) until a standard definition was developed.4,5 In recognition of the significance of TIC as a clinical problem, the NIH has funded the Trans-Agency Consortium for Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy (TACTIC) through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.6 TACTIC represents a consortium of investigators who have partnered in a collaborative effort between the NIH and the Department of Defense to investigate the problem of coagulopathy after trauma, ranging from large-scale clinical research studies at multiple sites to basic mechanistic laboratory investigations. In designing a multicenter study, it immediately became apparent that the lack of a unifying clinical definition of coagulopathy severity presents a major barrier to communication between investigators at various sites. Furthermore, interpretation of ongoing laboratory testing of coagulation should be compared in real time with clinical assessment of hemostasis. Finally, evidence exists to suggest that coagulopathy is, in part, driven by the anatomic location as well as mechanism of injury results in distinguishable phenotypes of TIC.7–9 As such, a robust scoring system to quantify the severity of coagulation disturbance, taking into account important clinical variables, is needed. Quantification of impaired hemostasis and bleeding due to coagulation disturbance as opposed to surgical bleeding (uncontrolled arterial or venous disruption) is, at times, challenging and at risk of misclassification. To address the potentially subjective nature of this assessment and to provide a balanced assessment, we propose to use a scoring system designed around a 5-point Likert scale (definitive positive, positive, possible positive, equivocal, and negative) to stratify the level of observer confidence in each assigned score.10 Such a stratified scheme prohibits calculation of sensitivity and specificity (no dichotomized results), and likelihood ratios will need to be used instead. Even though this is more complex, it better reflects the use of clinical scoring systems. We therefore propose the following quantitative scoring system for TIC (Table 1). One goal of the system is to differentiate injuries requiring hemostasis, which are not complicated by a coagulopathy (mechanical bleeding alone) versus mechanical bleeding from injuries compounded by biologic coagulopathy. Through the use of this system, we are attempting to distinguish between bleeding severity resulting from injury alone, that is, controllable with pressure or suturing/stapling versus bleeding, which persists due to a coagulopathy. Thus, to score higher than I for coagulopathy, the trauma surgeon must conclude that the bleeding is not simply due to a severe injury requiring ordinary hemostatic intervention. In addition, to facilitate coagulation research, we propose to further subclassify bleeding according to the source of bleeding. A modifier is included to denote the mechanism of injury, namely (p) for penetrating or (b) for blunt. The location of the patient when the score is calculated is to be indicated in parenthesis as the emergency department (ED), operating room (OR), or intensive care unit (ICU). A series of example cases with the corresponding scores are included in Table 2. We suggest that the score be determined by the attending trauma surgeon immediately after achieving surgical hemostasis or at the earliest feasible time point so as to best achieve an early snapshot of the severity of coagulopathy before product-based resuscitation. A clear distinction must be made by the clinician between impaired hemostasis (due to uncontrolled surgical bleeding) versus coagulopathy to attempt to limit the scoring to assessment of impaired coagulation. However, an inherent limitation in this scoring is that often, both entities exist and are dependent on one another. It is anticipated that the reliability of the scoring will increase as the time from injury extends as the full composition of injuries is identified and treated. The focus of the scoring system should be on bleeding diathesis after surgical hemorrhage is controlled.TABLE 1: Clinical Coagulopathy Score (I–V)TABLE 2: Clinical Case Examples for TIC Scoring SystemWe propose the use of this TIC scoring system for reliable and consistent quantification and reporting of the degree of coagulopathy. Generated by expert opinion, the score will be subjected to prospective validation as part of TACTIC's clinical investigations, and the clinical score will be linked to outcomes, morbidity, and mortality. In addition, comparison with laboratory testing is critical, and prospective analyses based on viscoelastic and other coagulation testing are needed to validate the clinical score. We believe that the TIC scoring system will provide a common language for the grading of clinical coagulopathy and allow for enhanced communication and research in this critical area. To effectively conduct multicenter investigations, the TACTIC team also addressed another major limitation in clinical investigation of TIC, that is, defining the role of coagulopathy in postinjury mortality.

When reading the statement, keep in mind that new knowledge is inevitably accumulating through medical research.Menopause is a natural process that occurs in women's lives as part of normal aging. Many women go through the menopausal transition with few or no symptoms, while some have significant or even disabling symptoms. Menopause is defined by the World Health Organization and the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) working group as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods that occurs naturally or is induced by surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Natural menopause is recognized after 12 consecutive months without menstrual periods that are not associated with a physiologic (e.g., lactation) or pathologic cause. Menopausal transition often begins with variations in length of the menstrual cycle. The hormonal changes during the menopausal transition can span several years.The following 3 periods or intervals were defined by experts at the STRAW working group in 2001:Reproductive stage: From menarche (first menstrual period) to the beginning of the perimenopause (when cycles become variable).Menopausal transition: The time of an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone and increased variability in cycle length, 2 skipped menstrual cycles with 60 or more days of amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), or both. The menopausal transition concludes with the final menstrual period (FMP) and the beginning of postmenopause.Postmenopause: Begins at the time of the FMP, although it is not recognized until after 12 months of amenorrhea.In this report, we use the term menopausal transition to mean the time from the late reproductive stage and entry into postmenopause. The term perimenopause is defined as the period immediately prior to menopause (when the biological and clinical features of approaching menopause begin) and the first year after menopause. Thus, perimenopause includes the menopausal transition and overlaps the first 12 months of postmenopause. This term is commonly encountered in the literature and in clinical practice because the proposed STRAW definitions were only published in 2001. The STRAW terminology is being validated, and results may further clarify these terms.The focus of this report is to identify menopausal symptoms and assess treatments for them on the basis of existing scientific evidence.We evaluate evidence that the following symptoms are, or are not, related to menopause and assess the treatments for them: hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and painful intercourse, sleep problems, mood and cognitive problems, somatic symptoms, urinary incontinence, bleeding problems, sexual dysfunction, and overall quality of life. Menopausal symptoms vary in combination, intensity, and duration, and we assess the evidence for these as well. Estrogen, either by itself or with progestins, has been the therapy of choice for decades for relieving menopause-related symptoms. Epidemiologic studies in the 1980s and 1990s suggested that estrogen-containing therapy might protect women from heart disease and other serious medical problems. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) was a large clinical trial of postmenopausal women (age range, 50 to 79 years [mean, 63.2 years]) that was designed to see whether estrogen with or without progestin therapy could prevent chronic conditions, such as heart disease and dementia. The estrogen with progestin portion of the trial ended early because of increased incidence of breast cancer. There were increases in blood clots, stroke, and heart disease among women who received this treatment as well. These findings raised serious questions about the safety of estrogen to treat symptoms of menopause. Many women stopped hormone replacement therapy, and some searched for alternative therapies. To reflect a shift of focus from ""replacement"" to use of hormones for relief of symptoms, we will use the term menopause hormonal therapy, which includes a range of doses and preparations of estrogen and progestin.Women and their health care providers need to know the safest and most effective medical and nonmedical treatments for menopausal symptoms. To address this need, the National Institute on Aging and the Office of Medical Applications of Research of the NIH sponsored a State-of-the-Science Conference on Management of Menopause-Related Symptoms on 21–23 March 2005, in Bethesda, Maryland. The conference planning committee posed 5 key questions and selected the list of symptoms for evaluation. During the first 2 days of the conference, experts presented information on the biology of the menopausal transition, the nature of the symptoms women experience, and strategies for relieving the common problems associated with the menopausal transition. After weighing all of the scientific evidence, including the data presented by both the speakers and a thorough review of the English-language literature identified in an evidence report prepared by the Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center, an independent panel prepared and presented a state-of-the-science statement answering the 5 key conference questions.1. What Is the Evidence that the Symptoms More Frequently Reported by Middle-Aged Women Are Attributable to Ovarian Aging and Senescence?Because women age as they progress from premenopause to postmenopause, it is difficult to determine which symptoms occurring during this time are due to ovarian aging specifically and which are due to general aging and/or life changes commonly experienced in midlife.

In addition, this document is intended to expand the understanding of patient risk stratification and case selection. A recent study confirmed that VARC definitions have already been incorporated into clinical and research practice and represent a new standard for consistency in reporting clinical outcomes of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI. However, as the clinical experience with this technology has matured and expanded, certain definitions have become unsuitable or ambiguous. Two in-person meetings (held in September 2011 in Washington, DC, USA, and in February 2012 in Rotterdam, Netherlands) involving VARC study group members, independent experts (including surgeons, interventional and non-interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, neurologists, geriatric specialists, and clinical trialists), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and industry representatives, provided much of the substantive discussion from which this VARC-2 consensus manuscript was derived. This document provides an overview of risk assessment and patient stratification that need to be considered for accurate patient inclusion in studies. Working groups were assigned to define the following clinical endpoints: mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, bleeding complications, acute kidney injury, vascular complications, conduction disturbances and arrhythmias, and a miscellaneous category including relevant complications not previously categorized. Furthermore, comprehensive echocardiographic recommendations are provided for the evaluation of prosthetic valve (dys)function. Definitions for the quality of life assessments are also reported. These endpoints formed the basis for several recommended composite endpoints. This VARC-2 document has provided further standardization of endpoint definitions for studies evaluating the use of TAVI, which will lead to improved comparability and interpretability of the study results, supplying an increasingly growing body of evidence with respect to TAVI and/or surgical aortic valve replacement. This initiative and document can furthermore be used as a model during current endeavours of applying definitions to other transcatheter valve therapies (for example, mitral valve repair).",OpenAlex,0,1,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,4.5

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of topical cocaine vs adrenaline on surgical field visualization and intraoperative bleeding during FESS.A randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 37 patients that underwent FESS for chronic rhinosinusitis were randomized to the side of the nose that received adrenaline or cocaine-soaked patties, and the side that was operated first. The surgeon evaluating the bleeding was blinded to the vasoconstrictor allocation. At the commencement of surgery and at regular 15-minute intervals, the operating surgeon evaluated the extent of bleeding in the operative field according to a validated scale. At each assessment, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, and end tidal CO2 were also recorded. At the end of each side, total blood loss was measured.There was no difference in the mean surgical field scores between the adrenaline and cocaine sides (2.04 ± 0.75 vs 2.17 ± 0.7, p = 0.24), nor the total blood loss (p = 0.43). On the cocaine side, there was a correlation between surgical field grade and duration of surgery (p < 0.05) as well as blood loss (p < 0.05) and MAP (p < 0.05).There is no difference in the quality of the surgical field achieved through the use of topical cocaine or adrenaline during FESS.

,10.1038/ajg.2014.385,Quality Indicators for Colonoscopy,The American Journal of Gastroenterology,2014.0,"ACG: American College of Gastroenterology; ADR: adenoma detection rate; APC: adenoma per colonoscopy; ASGE: American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy; CRC: colorectal cancer; PDR: polyp detection rate Colonoscopy is widely used for the diagnosis and treatment of colon disorders. Properly performed, colonoscopy is generally safe, accurate, and well-tolerated. Visualization of the mucosa of the entire large intestine and distal terminal ileum usually is possible during colonoscopy. Polyps can be removed during colonoscopy, thereby reducing the risk of colon cancer. Colonoscopy is the preferred method to evaluate the colon in most adult patients with large-bowel symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, abnormal results on radiographic studies of the colon, positive results on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening tests, post-polypectomy and post-cancer resection surveillance, and diagnosis and surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, colonoscopy is the most commonly used CRC screening test in the United States (1). Based on 2010 data, over 3.3 million outpatient colonoscopies are performed annually in the United States, with screening and polyp surveillance accounting for half of indications (2). Optimal effectiveness of colonoscopy depends on patient acceptance of the procedure, which depends mostly on acceptance of the bowel preparation (3). Preparation quality affects the completeness of examination, procedure duration, and the need to cancel or repeat procedures at earlier dates than would otherwise be needed (4, 5). Ineffective preparation is a major contributor to costs (6). Meticulous inspection (7, 8) and longer withdrawal times (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) are associated with higher adenoma detection rates (ADR). A high ADR is essential to rendering recommended intervals (15) between screening and surveillance examinations safe (16, 17). Optimal technique is needed to ensure a high probability of detecting dysplasia when present in inflammatory bowel disease (17, 18, 19, 20, 21). Finally, technical expertise and experience will help prevent adverse events that might offset the benefits of removing neoplastic lesions (22). Recent studies report that colonoscopy is less effective in preventing proximal colon cancer and cancer deaths (ie, colon cancer proximal to the splenic flexure) compared with distal cancer (ie, colon cancer at or distal to the splenic flexure) (23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28). Decreased protection against right-sided CRC is likely due to multiple factors. These include missed adenomas or incompletely resected adenomas; suboptimal bowel preparation; precancerous lesions that are endoscopically subtle or difficult to remove, such as sessile serrated polyps and flat and/or depressed adenomas, and differences in tumorigenesis between right-sided and left-sided cancers. Improving prevention of right-sided colon cancer is a major goal of colonoscopy quality programs. Five studies have established that gastroenterologists are more effective than surgeons or primary care physicians at preventing CRC by colonoscopy (27, 29, 30, 31, 32). This most likely reflects higher rates of complete examinations (ie, cecal intubation) (30) and higher rates of adenoma detection among gastroenterologists (33, 34). All endoscopists performing colonoscopy should measure the quality of their colonoscopy. Institutions where endoscopists from multiple specialties are practicing should reasonably expect all endoscopists to participate in the program and achieve recommended quality benchmarks. The quality of health care can be measured by comparing the performance of an individual or a group of individuals with an ideal or benchmark (35). The particular parameter that is being used for comparison is termed a quality indicator. A quality indicator often is reported as a ratio between the incidence of correct performance and the opportunity for correct performance (4) or as the proportion of interventions that achieve a predefined goal (35). Quality indicators can be divided into 3 categories: (1) structural measures—these assess characteristics of the entire health care environment (eg, participation by a physician or other clinician in systematic clinical database registry that includes consensus endorsed quality measures), (2) process measures—these assess performance during the delivery of care (eg, ADR and adequate biopsy sampling during colonoscopy for chronic ulcerative colitis), (3) outcome measures—these assess the results of the care that was provided (eg, the prevention of cancer by colonoscopy and reduction in the incidence of colonoscopic perforation). METHODOLOGY In 2006, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE)/American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Task Force on Quality in Endoscopy published their first version of quality indicators for colonoscopy (36). The present update integrates new data pertaining to previously proposed quality indicators and new quality indicators for performing colonoscopy (36). Indicators that had wide-ranging clinical application, were associated with variation in practice and outcomes, and were validated in clinical studies were prioritized. Clinical studies were identified through a computerized search of Medline followed by review of the bibliographies of all relevant articles. When such studies were absent, indicators were chosen by expert consensus. Although feasibility of measurement was a consideration, it is hoped that inclusion of highly relevant, but not yet easily measurable indicators, would promote their eventual adoption. Although a comprehensive list of quality indicators is proposed, it is recognized that, ultimately, only a small subset might be widely used for continuous quality improvement, benchmarking, or quality reporting. As in 2006, the current task force concentrated its attention on parameters related to endoscopic procedures; whereas the quality of care delivered to patients is clearly influenced by many factors related to the facilities in which endoscopy is performed, characterization of unit-related quality indicators was not included in the scope of this effort. The resultant quality indicators were graded on the strength of the supporting evidence (Table 1). Each quality indicator was classified as an outcome or a process measure. Although outcome quality indicators are preferred, some can be difficult to measure in routine clinical practice, because they need analysis of large amounts of data and long-term follow-up and may be confounded by other factors. In such cases, the task force deemed it reasonable to use process indicators as surrogate measures of high-quality endoscopy. The relative value of a process indicator hinges on the evidence that supports its association with a clinically relevant outcome, and such process measures were emphasized.Table 1: Grades of recommendationaThe quality indicators for this update were written in a manner that lends them to be developed",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding. We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation [1] indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations [2] indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations. Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization ( 2C ); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

The Child-Pugh classification has several drawbacks when used to determine survival in such patients. The survival of 231 patients at 4 medical centers within the United States who underwent elective TIPS was studied to develop statistical models to (1) predict patient survival and (2) identify those patients whose liver-related mortality post-TIPS would be 3 months or less. Among these elective TIPS patients, 173 had the procedure for prevention of variceal rebleeding and 58 for treatment of refractory ascites. Death related to liver disease occurred in 110 patients, 70 within 3 months. Cox proportional-hazards regression identified serum concentrations of bilirubin and creatinine, international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR), and the cause of the underlying liver disease as predictors of survival in patients undergoing elective TIPS, either for prevention of variceal rebleeding or for treatment of refractory ascites. These variables can be used to calculate a risk score (R) for patients undergoing elective TIPS. Patients with R &gt; 1.8 had a median survival of 3 months or less. This model was superior to both the Child-Pugh classification, as well as the Child-Pugh score, in predicting survival. Using logistic regression and the same variables, we also developed a nomogram that indicates which patients survive less than 3 months. Finally, the model was validated among an independent set of 71 patients from the Netherlands.

In recent years, the emphasis in providing surgical services has undergone remarkable change. Previously, patients undergoing surgical procedures remained in a hospital for many days after the operation. In 1994, 66% of all elective operations in the United States were performed on an outpatient basis [1]. More complex ambulatory procedures are being performed on sicker patients [2]. With the increased emphasis on early discharge after surgery and anesthesia, it is important to identify criteria that can be used to determine when patients can safely go home under the care of a friend or relative. In this article, we review current knowledge regarding the assessment of home-readiness after ambulatory surgery and discuss potential complications and appropriate treatment regimens. Defining Recovery Recovery is a continual process, the early stages of which overlap the end of intraoperative care. Patients cannot be considered fully recovered until they have returned to their preoperative physiological state. This entire process may last many days, but it can be conveniently divided into three distinct phases (Table 1) [3].Table 1: Stages of RecoveryEarly recovery (Phase I) lasts from discontinuation of anesthesia until patients have recovered their protective reflexes and motor function. Because they require close monitoring and supervision during this stage, it normally takes place in the high-dependency atmosphere of the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) with suitably trained nursing staff. In deciding when patients have recovered enough to allow their safe transfer to an ambulatory surgical unit (ASU), or Phase II recovery, the Aldrete scoring system may be used [4]. First described in 1970, and although not originally designed for ambulatory patients, it is still widely used in many PACU's in its original form. This system assigns a score of 0, 1, or 2 to activity, respiration, circulation, consciousness, and color, giving a maximal score of 10. A score of 9 indicates recovery sufficient for the patient to be transferred from the high-dependency PACU to the ASU. However, with the advent of pulse oximetry, a more reliable indicator of oxygenation than clinical observation, a modification of the Aldrete score has been suggested (Table 2) [5]. In this version, the need for room air O2 saturation is >92%. After patients were discharged, they underwent full recovery at home (Phase III recovery).Table 2: The Modified Aldrete Scoring System for Determining when Patients Are Ready for Discharge from the Postanesthesia Care UnitFast-Tracking With newer anesthetics and techniques that allow more rapid awakening, it has been suggested that early recovery may be completed in the operating room (OR). Patients are transferred directly to the ASU, bypassing the PACU [6,7]. In patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopic tubal ligation maintained with desflurane or sevoflurane, Aldrete scores of 10 were achieved significantly faster than in those maintained with propofol [6]. These investigators also demonstrated that 90% of the patients anesthetized with desflurane were fast-track-eligible on arrival in the PACU [6]. Apfelbaum et al. [8] evaluated bypassing PACU at five surgical sites. Anesthesiologists were instructed to assess all ambulatory surgical patients for recovery while still in the OR, using standardized discharge criteria typically used at the end of a PACU stay. The PACU bypass rate for patients who received general anesthesia (GA) varied from 13.9% to 42.1%. The cost of maintaining personnel constitutes the major expense in PACU time [6,9]. Therefore, because fast-tracking reduces PACU activity, the reduction in staffing requirements could result in potential cost-savings. Further research in this area is needed before implementing the fast-tracking concept safely and efficiently. Once patients have been transferred from the OR to the ASU, they should stay there until intermediate recovery is complete (i.e., coordinated, ambulating, and judged to be home-ready). For an ASU to be effective and efficient, it is important that patients not be detained unnecessarily once intermediate recovery is complete. However, premature discharge may lead not only to the possibility of patients suffering complications, but to readmission and medicolegal concerns. Although patients may have been discharged from the hospital, they cannot be considered fully recovered until they have returned to their preoperative physiological and functional state. Discharge Criteria It is the physician's responsibility to ensure that a patient is sufficiently recovered to leave the ASU under the appropriate care of a relative or other caregiver. Legal action may ensue if a patient who is discharged prematurely or inadequately supervised comes to harm as a result of residual psychomotor impairment [10]. However, ""a written policy establishing specific discharge criteria is a sound basis for a legally sufficient discharge decision"" [11]. Thus, the ASU nursing staff may discharge patients who meet specific written criteria. The key question is what criteria we should use to determine the home-readiness of a patient. Psychomotor Tests There have been many attempts to produce a simple reproducible test to assess a patient's recovery from anesthesia. Many of the psychomotor performance tests used in other fields and were adapted for evaluating the postanesthesia period. In 1969, a modified Gestalt test-the Trieger dot test-was proposed to measure recovery [12]. In this test, patients are asked to connect a series of dots to form a pattern. The number of dots missed in the line drawn represents the score. These scores improve as patients recover from anesthesia. The Trieger dot test is only one of a battery of psychomotor tests that measure recovery from anesthesia. The Maddox wing (a device to test extraocular muscle balance) [13], driving simulators [14], reaction time tests, and peg board tests [15] have all been used. The flicker fusion threshold [16], which measures the frequency at which the patient perceives a flashing light to be continuous, has been used. So also have perceptual speed tests [17] and the digit symbol substitution test [18]. Recently, a complex test assessing patients' balance by standing them on a dual forceplate has been suggested [19]. Despite the number and variety of tests in use, none has been specifically validated by follow-up studies providing adequate criteria to guide discharge in the ambulatory setting. Many are complex and time-consuming, and they may also require",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial study was part of the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) Study. The present study evaluated the effects of rosuvastatin, 20 mg daily, or placebo in 17,802 apparently healthy men and women with LDL cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels of 2.0 mg per liter or higher. Following randomization, study subjects were followed for the occurrence of the combined primary end point: myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes. The trial was terminated after a median follow-up of 1.9 years (maximum, 5.0). As compared with the placebo at the 12-month visit, rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 50%, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels by 37%, and triglyceride levels by 17% (P < .001 for all three comparisons). For rosuvastatin and placebo, the rates of the primary end point were 0.77 and 1.36 per 100 person-years of follow-up, respectively; the hazard ratio (HR) for rosuvastatin was 0.56, with a 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.46–0.69 (P < .00001). The rates of the individual components of the primary trial end point for rosuvastatin and placebo, respectively, were as follows: (1) 0.17 and 0.37 for fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30– 0.70; P < .0002); (2) 0.18 and 0.34 for fatal or nonfatal stroke (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34–0.79; P < .002); (3) 0.41 and 0.77 for arterial revascularization or unstable angina (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40–0.70; P < .00001); and (4) 0.45 and 0.85 for the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40–0.69; P < .00001). The rates of death from any cause in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups, respectively, were 1.00 and 1.25 per 100 person-years of follow-up; the HR for the rosuvastatin group was 0.80, with a 95% CI of 0.67– 0.97 (P < .02).

,10.1002/hep.26972,Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation,Hepatology,2013.0,"This practice guideline has been approved by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation and represents the position of both Associations. Guidelines on Evaluation for Liver Transplantation (LT) were published in 2005 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD).1 In the interim there have been major advances in the management of chronic liver disease, most notably in antiviral therapy for chronic viral hepatitis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has assumed increasing prominence as a cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requiring liver transplant.2 Furthermore, individual disease indications for LT such as HCC have been refined3 and specific guidelines have appeared for chronic viral hepatitis.4 Reflecting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the evaluation of this complex group of patients who have the comorbidities typical of middle age, recommendations have been developed to assist in their cardiac management.5 With an increasing number of long-term survivors of LT there has been a greater focus on quality of life and attention to comorbid conditions impacting recipient longevity.6 The purpose of the current Guidelines is to provide an evidence-based set of recommendations for the evaluation of adult patients who are potentially candidates for LT. These recommendations provide a data-supported approach. They are based on the following: (1) formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic; (2) guideline policies covered by the AASLD-Policy on Development and Use of Practice Guidelines; and (3) the experience of the authors in the specified topic. Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information. To more fully characterize the available evidence supporting the recommendations, the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup with minor modifications (Table 1). The classifications and recommendations are based on three categories: the source of evidence in levels I through III; the quality of evidence designated by high (A), moderate (B), or low quality (C); and the strength of recommendations classified as strong or weak.11 Guyatt GH, Oxman AD, Vist GE, Kunz R, Falck-Ytter Y, Alono-Coello P, et al. GRADE: an emerging consensus on rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. BMJ 2008;336:924–926. The literature databases and the search strategies are outlined below. The resulting literature database was available to all members of the writing group. They selected references within their field of expertise and experience and graded the references according to the GRADE system. The selection of references for the guideline was based on a validation of the appropriateness of the study design for the stated purpose, a relevant number of patients under study, and confidence in the participating centers and authors. References on original data were preferred and those that were found unsatisfactory in any of these respects were excluded from further evaluation. There may be limitations in this approach when recommendations are needed on rare problems or problems on which scant original data are available. In such cases it may be necessary to rely on less qualified references with a low grading. Due to the important changes in the treatment of complications of cirrhosis (renal failure, infections, variceal bleeding), studies performed more than 30 years ago have generally not been considered for these guidelines. The funding for the development of this Practice Guideline was provided by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Liver disease is the twelfth commonest cause of mortality in adults in the United States, resulting in 34,000 deaths annually from cirrhosis.7 In addition, the rising incidence of HCC in the United States is reflected in an increasing number of deaths from HCC. Access to LT, however, has profoundly altered the management of advanced liver disease. Management of decompensated cirrhosis and acute liver failure before the advent of LT was limited to attempts to ameliorate complications. In contrast, successful LT extends life expectancy and enhances quality of life.6 The term orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) refers to placement of the new organ in the same location as the explanted liver. Although most LT recipients receive a whole organ from a deceased donor, an organ can be ""split,"" with a pediatric recipient receiving a left lateral segment and an adult recipient the larger right lobe. Live donor transplant using the left hepatic lobe initially introduced for pediatric recipients has been extended into adult recipients using the donor's right lobe. Although live donor transplant is widely employed, it remains controversial, with continuing concern about potential risks to the donor, especially when right lobe resection is required for an adult recipient.8-10 Recipients of live donor transplant have reduced waiting list mortality compared to potential recipients of deceased donor organs.11 Live donor transplant should only be contemplated when LT with a deceased donor is unlikely to occur within a reasonable time frame given the severity of the potential candidate's liver disease. Irrespective of the source of the graft, deceased or live, LT is a surgically challenging procedure with dissection and removal of a diseased liver from an abdominal cavity with extensive venous collaterals due to portal hypertension with subsequent implantation of the graft and creation of vascular and biliary anastomoses. Reflecting the complexity of surgery in recipients who are often debilitated because of their advanced liver disease, a number of technical complications can occur as well as a variety of adverse effects from therapeutic immunosuppression. Despite these concerns, however, LT has revolutionized the management of severe liver disease. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) facilitates organ allocation in the United States and also records graft and recipient outcomes. The UNOS database allows critical evaluation of center- and disease-specific recipient outcomes with LT as well as guiding organ allocation policies. Analogous organizations are involved in organ allocation and data",OpenAlex,0,1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,8.5

,10.1111/j.1365-2516.2008.01750.x,Musculoskeletal measurement tools from the International Prophylaxis Study Group (IPSG<scp>)</scp>,Haemophilia,2008.0,"Haemophilia is a sex-linked inherited disorder caused by deficiencies of coagulation factor VIII (haemophilia A) or IX (haemophilia B) [1]. The disorder occurs in all ethnic groups with an estimated frequency of 1 per 5–10 000 live male births. The ratio of haemophilia A to B cases is approximately 4:1. Traditionally, the haemophilias are classified as severe, moderate or mild based on circulating factor levels <1%, 1–5% and >5%, respectively. In many European centres a factor level of <2% is used to define the severe phenotype. The hallmark of the severe haemophilias is recurrent bleeding into joints, in particular, the elbows, knees and ankles, from an early age in life. If these bleeds (haemarthroses) are untreated or inadequately treated, joint damage occurs leading to crippling arthropathy by the second decade of life [2]. Prevention of haemophilic arthropathy is possible by the regular replacement of the deficient clotting factor started at an early age in life, and before any significant joint disease has occurred (primary prophylaxis); if prophylaxis is started at an older age after joint disease has already occurred (secondary prophylaxis), the benefits are significantly diminished [3–5]. The current challenge regarding factor prophylaxis in the haemophilia population relates to affordability as clotting factor concentrates are extremely expensive. Efficacy is not an issue; the results of long-term observational studies plus the recent report of a prospective randomized controlled trial of primary prophylaxis versus on-demand therapy for young boys with severe haemophilia A provide solid evidence in support of regular replacement therapy (prophylaxis) with the aim of preventing recurrent joint bleeding [6–12]. The excellent musculoskeletal results observed in compliant patients on primary prophylaxis regimens has led the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) and a number of national haemophilia organizations to recommend primary prophylaxis as a standard of care for young boys with severe haemophilia. The challenge, unfortunately, is cost. Full-dose prophylaxis, defined as the infusion of 20–40 Units of factor VIII given on alternate days or factor IX given twice weekly is extremely expensive. As an example, in Canada in 2001, prophylaxis accounted for 50% of the annual factor VIII use in the country [13]. For the majority of individuals with haemophilia worldwide, the high cost of prophylaxis makes this highly effective management approach a distant dream. In every sense, haemophilia is an example of the clash that results from the wonders of modern day scientific discovery and the reality of delivering affordable, effective healthcare. Thanks to genetic engineering, ultra safe, highly effective recombinant factor VIII and IX clotting factor concentrates are now available for use in the haemophilia population; however, the high cost of these concentrates is the greatest single barrier to the implementation of factor prophylaxis worldwide. It was against this background that, in 2001, the International Prophylaxis Study Group (IPSG) was formed. The International Prophylaxis Study Group (IPSG) is a not-for-profit study group whose mandate is the acquisition of new knowledge concerning factor prophylaxis in persons with inherited bleeding disorders, and the dissemination of this knowledge globally. The coordinating site for the IPSG is The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, and the activities of the study group are overseen by an international steering committee comprised of leaders in the field of haemophilia (see Appendix 1). Funding for activities of the IPSG is provided by unrestricted grants from industry partners to The Hospital for Sick Children Foundation. The key initial focus of the IPSG has been the study of outcome measures other than factor levels, in particular measures related to the early detection and quantification of joint disease using physical examination and imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures and economic analyses. The steering committee reasoned that these measurement tools were essential to critically assess different prophylaxis regimens using currently available factor concentrates or, in the future, novel concentrates (e.g. long acting factor VIII/IX preparations). It is hoped that this information generated by the IPSG will help to persuade governments to fund programs of prophylaxis in countries where such treatment is either not available, or available only to individuals/families able to afford the high cost of prophylaxis. The remarkable achievements of two IPSG Working Groups, the Expert Physical Therapy (PT) Working Group and the Expert Imaging Working Group, are the subject of this report. The Expert PT Working Group has developed and tested a new scoring system, the hemophilia joint health score (HJHS) that builds on the orthopaedic joint score recommended by the Orthopedic Advisory Committee of the World Federation of Hemophilia. The new score is optimized for use in young boys with no or minimal joint disease. In parallel, the Expert Imaging Working Group has developed a single international MRI scoring system for use in persons with haemophilia, which can be used to detect and assess minimal and mild structural joint changes that are difficult to evaluate with X-ray. The memberships of these expert working groups (Appendix 1) were drawn from those haemophilia treatment centres active in the field of joint assessment, and includes leading experts in haemophilia care, PT (the Expert PT Working Group) and imaging (the Expert Imaging Working Group). The work performed by these two expert groups to create and test these single international scoring systems is a tribute to international scientific collaboration, and is detailed in the report that follows. A consistent method of measurement and classification of joint health status in individuals with haemophilia is critical for assessing progression of joint disease, establishing or changing treatment protocols and measuring efficacy of treatment regimens or surgical interventions. To address this need, in the early 1980s a group of orthopaedists from Germany, Israel, the UK, Venezuela and the USA developed a measurement and classification instrument known as the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) physical examination scale [14]. Although appropriate for measuring the more severe degree of haemophilic joint degeneration (arthropathy) prevalent at the time, psychometric properties of the scale were never established.

Patients were followed up for development of delirium over 2158 ICU days using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale.Main Outcome MeasuresPrimary outcomes included 6-month mortality, overall hospital length of stay, and length of stay in the post-ICU period. Secondary outcomes were ventilator-free days and cognitive impairment at hospital discharge.ResultsOf 275 patients, 51 (18.5%) had persistent coma and died in the hospital. Among the remaining 224 patients, 183 (81.7%) developed delirium at some point during the ICU stay. Baseline demographics including age, comorbidity scores, dementia scores, activities of daily living, severity of illness, and admission diagnoses were similar between those with and without delirium (P&gt;.05 for all). Patients who developed delirium had higher 6-month mortality rates (34% vs 15%, P = .03) and spent 10 days longer in the hospital than those who never developed delirium (P&lt;.001). After adjusting for covariates (including age, severity of illness, comorbid conditions, coma, and use of sedatives or analgesic medications), delirium was independently associated with higher 6-month mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-7.7; P = .008), and longer hospital stay (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-3.0; P&lt;.001).

Injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci are common in both athletes and the general population. At 10 to 20 years after the diagnosis, on average, 50% of those with a diagnosed anterior cruciate ligament or meniscus tear have osteoarthritis with associated pain and functional impairment: the young patient with an old knee. These individuals make up a substantial proportion of the overall osteoarthritis population. There is a lack of evidence to support a protective role of repair or reconstructive surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament or meniscus against osteoarthritis development. A consistent finding in a review of the literature is the often poor reporting of critical study variables, precluding data pooling or a meta-analysis. Osteoarthritis development in the injured joints is caused by intra-articular pathogenic processes initiated at the time of injury, combined with long-term changes in dynamic joint loading. Variation in outcome is reinforced by additional variables associated with the individual such as age, sex, genetics, obesity, muscle strength, activity, and reinjury. A better understanding of these variables may improve future prevention and treatment strategies. In evaluating medical treatment, we now expect large randomized clinical trials complemented by postmarketing monitoring. We should strive toward a comparable level of quality of evidence in surgical treatment of knee injuries. In instances in which a randomized clinical trial is not feasible, natural history and other observational cohort studies need to be as carefully designed and reported as the classic randomized clinical trial, to yield useful information.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,True,,,,,A,High,,general,none,8.0

European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625-651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467-1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA.

At each visit, patients were interviewed and underwent a physical examination, pulmonary-function testing, a six-minute-walk test, and a quality-of-life evaluation.Patients who survived the acute respiratory distress syndrome were young (median age, 45 years) and severely ill (median Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation score, 23) and had a long stay in the intensive care unit (median, 25 days). Patients had lost 18 percent of their base-line body weight by the time they were discharged from the intensive care unit and stated that muscle weakness and fatigue were the reasons for their functional limitation. Lung volume and spirometric measurements were normal by 6 months, but carbon monoxide diffusion capacity remained low throughout the 12-month follow-up. No patients required supplemental oxygen at 12 months, but 6 percent of patients had arterial oxygen saturation values below 88 percent during exercise. The median score for the physical role domain of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (a health-related quality-of-life measure) increased from 0 at 3 months to 25 at 12 months (score in the normal population, 84).

In this phase 3 study, we evaluated the effect of the addition of bevacizumab to radiotherapy-temozolomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma.We randomly assigned patients with supratentorial glioblastoma to receive intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo, plus radiotherapy (2 Gy 5 days a week; maximum, 60 Gy) and oral temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day) for 6 weeks. After a 28-day treatment break, maintenance bevacizumab (10 mg per kilogram intravenously every 2 weeks) or placebo, plus temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter per day for 5 days), was continued for six 4-week cycles, followed by bevacizumab monotherapy (15 mg per kilogram intravenously every 3 weeks) or placebo until the disease progressed or unacceptable toxic effects developed. The coprimary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival.A total of 458 patients were assigned to the bevacizumab group, and 463 patients to the placebo group. The median progression-free survival was longer in the bevacizumab group than in the placebo group (10.6 months vs. 6.2 months; stratified hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.74; P<0.001). The benefit with respect to progression-free survival was observed across subgroups. Overall survival did not differ significantly between groups (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.02; P=0.10). The respective overall survival rates with bevacizumab and placebo were 72.4% and 66.3% at 1 year (P=0.049) and 33.9% and 30.1% at 2 years (P=0.24).

The Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee is composed of Society members who are chosen because they have demonstrated expertise in the specialty of colon and rectal surgery. This Committee was created to lead international efforts in defining quality care for conditions related to the colon, rectum, and anus. This is accompanied by developing Clinical Practice Guidelines based on the best available evidence. These guidelines are inclusive and not prescriptive. Their purpose is to provide information based on which decisions can be made, rather than to dictate a specific form of treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners, health care workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Fecal incontinence is a frequent and debilitating condition that may result from a multitude of different causes. It is defined as the uncontrolled passage of feces or gas over at least 1 month's duration, in an individual of at least 4 years of age, who had previously achieved control.1–4 In a large survey of female patients, the term ""accidental bowel leakage"" was preferred.5 Incontinence has a negative impact on self-esteem and quality of life and may result in significant secondary morbidity, disability, and cost.6 Reported prevalence rates vary widely depending on the method used and the target population examined but, in general, range between 1.4% and 18%. In institutionalized patients, however, incontinence may affect up to 50%, and it is a frequent reason for transfer to nursing homes.7–11 The Mature Woman's Health Study used Neilson data to survey nearly 6000 women aged ≥45 (86% response rate), and indicated that nearly 20% of women have fecal incontinence at least once per year, whereas 9.5% have at least 1 episode per month.5 Treatment is challenging and needs to be individualized.2,4,12 Apart from conservative and supportive measures, a number of interventions are available that vary in efficacy and morbidity. Over the past several years, new technologies have been developed, and others are emerging from clinical trials to commercialization. Their specific roles in the management of fecal incontinence have not yet been completely defined. The scope of this updated practice parameter (last version 2007)2 is to address the evaluation and management of patients with fecal incontinence based on a thorough review of the published evidence. METHODS An organized search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews was performed through March 2014. Key word combinations included ""fecal incontinence"" AND [""fecal OR anal OR stool""], AND [""physical therapy OR rehabilitation OR biofeedback""], AND [""sphincteroplasty"" OR ""implants"" OR ""bowel sphincter"" OR ""artificial sphincter"" OR ""radiofrequency"" OR ""sacral nerve stimulation"" OR ""injectable""]. Directed searches of the embedded references from the primary articles were also performed in selected circumstances. The primary authors reviewed all English language manuscripts and studies in adults, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. In selected instances where a full manuscript was not yet available, reports of conference proceedings were reviewed. Recommendations were formulated by the primary authors and reviewed by the entire Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee. The final grade of recommendation was performed by using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system13 (Table 1) and approved by the entire Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee.Table 1: The GRADE system-grading recommendationsEVALUATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT 1. A thorough disease history should be obtained to define the etiology and specific risk factors for incontinence, characterize the duration and severity of primary symptoms, and capture secondary problems and associated pathologies. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low- or very low-quality evidence, 1C. Continence depends on the complex relationships between the anal sphincter and pelvic floor musculature, rectal reservoir function (capacity, compliance), stool consistency, and neurologic function. Conditions or defects that alter any of these factors may result in fecal incontinence. On an individual basis, however, the etiology of fecal incontinence may be multifactorial and the relative contribution of each factor may not be determined with certainty. A full discussion of contributing factors is beyond the scope of a clinical practice guideline. However, pregnancy, chronic diarrhea, diabetes mellitus, previous anorectal surgery, urinary incontinence, smoking, obesity, limited physical activity, white race, and neurologic disease have all been found to be risk factors for fecal incontinence in large population-based studies.7,14 Sphincter disruption from obstetric injury is clinically recognized in approximately 10% of all vaginal deliveries, but occult sphincter damage that does not cause immediate postpartum incontinence may be identified in up to 21% to 35% of vaginal deliveries.9,15 A higher incidence was seen in those who were multiparous or had instrument-assisted deliveries.1,16 Forceps delivery, occipito-posterior presentation of the child, and prolonged labor are independent risk factors.1 An estimated one-third of these occult defects may result in symptoms of incontinence or urgency at a later date. The extent of a sphincter defect does not necessarily correlate with the degree of fecal incontinence. Furthermore, those with ultrasound evidence of a sphincter defect without clinical signs of incontinence postpartum do not appear to have deterioration of continence in the first decade.17 Evolution of other factors (eg, menopause) and a decompensation of coping mechanisms may be responsible for what may be a long delay between the time of injury and onset of symptoms. A history of anorectal procedures (eg, hemorrhoidectomy, sphincterotomy, fistula surgery) may frequently be identified in patients with symptoms of incontinence, particularly in men.4,18 This finding contrasts with low percentages of incontinence reported for these procedures,19 reflecting the fact that short-term follow-up may",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,none,10.5

Its objectives are to provide the researcher in the safety evaluation laboratory with an up‐to‐date, easy‐to‐use set of data sheets to aid in the study design process whilst at the same time affording maximum welfare considerations to the experimental animals. Although this article is targeted at researchers in the European Pharmaceutical Industry, it is considered that the principles underpinning the data sets and refinement proposals are equally applicable to all those who use these techniques on animals in their research, whether in research institutes, universities or other sectors of industry. The implications of this article may lead to discussion with regulators, such as those responsible for pharmacopoeial testing. There are numerous publications dealing with the administration of test substances and the removal of blood samples, and many laboratories also have their own ‘in‐house’ guidelines that have been developed by custom and practice over many years. Within European Union Directive 86/609EEC1 we have an obligation to refine experiments to cause the minimum amount of stress. We hope that this article will provide background data useful to those responsible for protocol design and review. This guide is based on peer‐reviewed publications whenever possible, but where this is not possible we have used ‘in‐house’ data and the experience of those on the working party (as well as helpful comments submitted by the industry) for a final opinion. The guide also addresses the continuing need to refine the techniques associated with the administration of substances and the withdrawal of blood, and suggests ways of doing so. Data‐sharing between laboratories should be encouraged to avoid duplication of animal work, as well as sharing practical skills concerning animal welfare and scientific problems caused by ‘overdosing’ in some way or another. The recommendations in this guide refer to the ‘normal’ animal, and special consideration is needed, for instance, during pregnancy and lactation. Interpretation of studies may be confounded when large volumes are administered or excessive sampling employed, particularly if anaesthetics are used.

,10.1213/ane.0000000000002121,Estimating Blood Loss,Anesthesia & Analgesia,2017.0,"Surgical hemostasis is a central component of patient blood management,1 for which there is now a growing list of pharmacologic agents with the potential to be effective in reducing perioperative blood loss.2 The most straightforward means to demonstrate efficacy of such interventions in clinical trials is in the reduction of mortality or in allogeneic blood transfusions, which can be high hurdles that may be difficult to achieve, depending on the clinical trial design, patient setting, sample size cohorts, etc. At one extreme of this spectrum is the clinical randomization of an antifibrinolytic in significant head injury (CRASH-2) study, which enrolled a very large number of trauma patients in order to be able to demonstrate improved mortality in patients treated with adjuvant tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy.3 At the other end of the spectrum for efficacy is the demonstration of reduced perioperative bleeding (ie, improved surgical hemostasis) in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery who were treated with TXA.4 In this instance, perisurgical blood loss may be only an indirect metric for demonstrating improved clinical patient outcomes, although there was an indication that allogeneic blood transfusions were reduced. Unfortunately, methods for quantifying estimated surgical blood loss (EBL) have long been felt to be inaccurate and, therefore, were variable and poorly correlated with other clinical outcomes.5 In this issue, Lopez-Picado et al6 have used data from their previously published clinical trial4 to assess direct measures (external blood loss) and indirect calculations for EBL (using 4 previously published formulas plus a fifth formula developed by the authors). Notably, although the majority of formulas reaffirmed a reduction in blood loss with TXA administration during total hip arthroplasty compared to placebo, calculation using the Gross formula resulted in no significant difference in EBL between treatment groups on postoperative day 4. Additionally, as the amount of blood loss increased, the agreement in EBL among formulas decreased, highlighting the difficulty in accurately quantifying large-volume EBL. Thus, the authors concluded that these metrics are useful for evaluating the efficacy of interventions aiming to decrease blood loss but do not ensure that the values themselves are sufficiently accurate for absolute measuring. What does this mean for the potential role(s) of EBL for use as a clinical metric? Estimating blood loss has a number of potentially important clinical roles (Table). But in each of these instances, the method for measuring EBL must be sufficiently accurate and validated in order to be accepted as a quality or patient care metric.Table.: Potential Value of Accurately Determining Estimated Perisurgical Blood LossOne approach is the use of validated bleeding severity scales such as for clinical studies investigating hemostatic agents.7 These are based on a clinician-reported scale that is based on the essential elements and criteria to evaluate a clinician-reported scale of the US Food and Drug Administration.8 Alternative approaches to EBL include gravimetric, colorimetric, photometric, spectrophotometric, and feature extraction imaging.9–11 Ironically, the least important role for quantifying EBL may be as an indicator for the need for red blood cell transfusion therapy. This is because while concurrent estimates of blood loss are relevant, they should be accompanied by other clinical parameters also important for transfusion decisions, including patient vital signs and serial hemoglobin level determinations. However, as a post hoc measure of hemostasis, EBL can be used as a metric for comparison of surgical or anesthetic techniques. For example, determinations of reduced bleeding under regional anesthesia compared to general anesthesia12–15 may influence choice of anesthetic technique and recommendations for standardized clinical pathways for routine surgery. Similarly, EBL may be used as part of peer performance review in surgical techniques for hospital credentialing. Far more intriguing is the value of EBL for perioperative decision-making: whether quantitative intraoperative blood loss is higher than a predetermined threshold can be an indicator for an anatomic source such as a retrocardiac bleeding vessel in cardiothoracic surgery or whether quantitative blood loss is less than such a threshold, suggesting that bleeding is more likely due to coagulopathy and can be managed with a treatment algorithm, based on point-of-care testing and other management options such as plasma, platelets, fibrinogen, factor VIII/von Willebrand, and factor XIII therapies. Unfortunately, a reliable quantitative method for measurement of intraoperative blood loss is still lacking. Visual estimation of blood loss is universally accepted to be inaccurate,16 and although formulas to calculate EBL have become increasingly sophisticated, incorporating multiple clinical parameters, their optimization is plagued by the absence of a reference standard to ensure accuracy. As a consequence, adoption of EBL alone as a trigger for clinical decision-making will require further advances in technology to provide reliable data. Until that time, determinations of EBL must be used in combination with laboratory data and clinical assessment to guide perioperative management. DISCLOSURES Name: Lawrence T. Goodnough, MD.

Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), a brief measure of the severity and impact of cancer-related symptoms. METHODS A list of symptoms was generated from symptom inventories and by panels of clinicians. Twenty-six symptoms and 6 interference items were rated by a validation sample of 527 outpatients, a sample of 30 inpatients from the blood and bone marrow transplantation service, and a cross-validation sample of 113 outpatients. Clinical judgment and statistical techniques were used to reduce the number of symptoms. Reliability, validity, and sensitivity of the MDASI were examined. RESULTS Cluster analysis, best subset analysis, and clinical judgment reduced the number of symptoms to a ""core"" list of 13 that accounted for 64% of the variance in symptom distress. Factor analysis demonstrated a similar pattern in both outpatient samples, and two symptom factors and the interference scale were reliable. Expected differences in symptom pattern and severity were found between patients with ""good"" versus ""poor"" performance status and between patients in active therapy and patients who were seen for follow-up. Patients rated fatigue-related symptoms as the most severe. Groups of patients classified by disease or treatment had severe symptoms that were not on the ""core"" list. CONCLUSIONS The core items of the MDASI accounted for the majority of symptom distress reported by cancer patients in active treatment and those who were followed after treatment. The MDASI should prove useful for symptom surveys, clinical trials, and patient monitoring, and its format should allow Internet or telephone administration.

Methods— A formal literature search of MEDLINE (November 1, 2006, through May 1, 2010) was performed. Data were synthesized with the use of evidence tables. Writing group members met by teleconference to discuss data-derived recommendations. The American Heart Association Stroke Council's Levels of Evidence grading algorithm was used to grade each recommendation. The guideline draft was reviewed by 7 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Leadership and Manuscript Oversight Committees. It is intended that this guideline be fully updated every 3 years. Results— Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the care of patients presenting with aSAH. The focus of the guideline was subdivided into incidence, risk factors, prevention, natural history and outcome, diagnosis, prevention of rebleeding, surgical and endovascular repair of ruptured aneurysms, systems of care, anesthetic management during repair, management of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia, management of hydrocephalus, management of seizures, and management of medical complications. Conclusions— aSAH is a serious medical condition in which outcome can be dramatically impacted by early, aggressive, expert care.

,10.1016/s2214-109x(18)30386-3,High-quality health systems in the Sustainable Development Goals era: time for a revolution,The Lancet Global Health,2018.0,"Although health outcomes have improved in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the past several decades, a new reality is at hand. Changing health needs, growing public expectations, and ambitious new health goals are raising the bar for health systems to produce better health outcomes and greater social value. But staying on current trajectory will not suffice to meet these demands. What is needed are high-quality health systems that optimise health care in each given context by consistently delivering care that improves or maintains health, by being valued and trusted by all people, and by responding to changing population needs. Quality should not be the purview of the elite or an aspiration for some distant future; it should be the DNA of all health systems. Furthermore, the human right to health is meaningless without good quality care because health systems cannot improve health without it. We propose that health systems be judged primarily on their impacts, including better health and its equitable distribution; on the confidence of people in their health system; and on their economic benefit, and processes of care, consisting of competent care and positive user experience. The foundations of high-quality health systems include the population and their health needs and expectations, governance of the health sector and partnerships across sectors, platforms for care delivery, workforce numbers and skills, and tools and resources, from medicines to data. In addition to strong foundations, health systems need to develop the capacity to measure and use data to learn. High-quality health systems should be informed by four values: they are for people, and they are equitable, resilient, and efficient. For this Commission, we examined the literature, analysed surveys, and did qualitative and quantitative research to evaluate the quality of care available to people in LMICs across a range of health needs included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We explored the ethical dimensions of high-quality care in resource-constrained settings and reviewed available measures and improvement approaches. We reached five conclusions: Data from a range of countries and conditions show systematic deficits in quality of care. In LMICs, mothers and children receive less than half of recommended clinical actions in a typical preventive or curative visit, less than half of suspected cases of tuberculosis are correctly managed, and fewer than one in ten people diagnosed with major depressive disorder receive minimally adequate treatment. Diagnoses are frequently incorrect for serious conditions, such as pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and newborn asphyxia. Care can be too slow for conditions that require timely action, reducing chances of survival. At the system level, we found major gaps in safety, prevention, integration, and continuity, reflected by poor patient retention and insufficient coordination across platforms of care. One in three people across LMICs cited negative experiences with their health system in the areas of attention, respect, communication, and length of visit (visits of 5 min are common); on the extreme end of these experiences were disrespectful treatment and abuse. Quality of care is worst for vulnerable groups, including the poor, the less educated, adolescents, those with stigmatised conditions, and those at the edges of health systems, such as people in prisons. Universal health coverage (UHC) can be a starting point for improving the quality of health systems. Improving quality should be a core component of UHC initiatives, alongside expanding coverage and financial protection. Governments should start by establishing a national quality guarantee for health services, specifying the level of competence and user experience that people can expect. To ensure that all people will benefit from improved services, expansion should prioritise the poor and their health needs from the start. Progress on UHC should be measured through effective (quality-corrected) coverage. More than 8 million people per year in LMICs die from conditions that should be treatable by the health system. In 2015 alone, these deaths resulted in US$6 trillion in economic losses. Poor-quality care is now a bigger barrier to reducing mortality than insufficient access. 60% of deaths from conditions amenable to health care are due to poor-quality care, whereas the remaining deaths result from non-utilisation of the health system. High-quality health systems could prevent 2·5 million deaths from cardiovascular disease, 1 million newborn deaths, 900 000 deaths from tuberculosis, and half of all maternal deaths each year. Quality of care will become an even larger driver of population health as utilisation of health systems increases and as the burden of disease shifts to more complex conditions. The high mortality rates in LMICs for treatable causes, such as injuries and surgical conditions, maternal and newborn complications, cardiovascular disease, and vaccine preventable diseases, illustrate the breadth and depth of the health-care quality challenge. Poor-quality care can lead to other adverse outcomes, including unnecessary health-related suffering, persistent symptoms, loss of function, and a lack of trust and confidence in health systems. Waste of resources and catastrophic expenditures are economic side effects of poor-quality health systems. As a result of this, only one-quarter of people in LMICs believe that their health systems work well. Measurement is key to accountability and improvement, but available measures do not capture many of the processes and outcomes that matter most to people. At the same time, data systems generate many metrics that produce inadequate insight at a substantial cost in funds and health workers' time. For example, although inputs such as medicines and equipment are commonly counted in surveys, these are weakly related to the quality of care that people receive. Indicators such as proportion of births with skilled attendants do not reflect quality of childbirth care and might lead to false complacency about progress in maternal and newborn health. This Commission calls for fewer, but better, measures of health system quality to be generated and used at national and subnational levels. Countries should report health system performance to the public annually by use of a dashboard of key metrics (eg, health outcomes, people's confidence in the system, system competence, and user experience) along with measures of financial protection and equity.

There are two roles for MTC: one is to strengthen inference concerning the relative efficacy of two treatments, by including both ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ comparisons. The other is to facilitate simultaneous inference regarding all treatments, in order for example to select the best treatment. In this paper, we present a range of Bayesian hierarchical models using the Markov chain Monte Carlo software WinBUGS. These are multivariate random effects models that allow for variation in true treatment effects across trials. We consider models where the between‐trials variance is homogeneous across treatment comparisons as well as heterogeneous variance models. We also compare models with fixed (unconstrained) baseline study effects with models with random baselines drawn from a common distribution. These models are applied to an illustrative data set and posterior parameter distributions are compared. We discuss model critique and model selection, illustrating the role of Bayesian deviance analysis, and node‐based model criticism. The assumptions underlying the MTC models and their parameterization are also discussed.

,10.1111/j.1365-2516.2007.01552.x,Optimizing outcomes for patients with severe haemophilia A,Haemophilia,2007.0,"Haemophilia A is an inherited, sex-linked disorder in which coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is deficient or absent [1]. The hallmark of the severe form of the disease, defined as plasma FVIII level of <1% of normal [2], is early, recurrent bleeding into soft tissues and joints [3]. Intra-articular bleeding (haemarthrosis) accounts for more than 90% of all serious bleeding events in patients with severe haemophilia, and 80% of these bleeds involve the knees, elbows and ankles [1]. An acute haemarthrosis is typified by rapid joint swelling that may be preceded by a prodrome of tingling, stiffness and pain (Fig. 1) [4,5]. Recurrent bleeding over time into the same joint (a target joint) results in progressive joint damage and the development of haemophilic arthropathy, characterized by synovial hypertrophy, cartilage damage, loss of joint space and bony changes (Fig. 2) [6,7]. Decreased use of a target joint leads to ongoing muscle atrophy, ankylosis, osteoporosis, bone cysts, and eventually, crippling arthritis by young adulthood [3,7]. Acute hemarthrosis. The right (R) knee is swollen, warm and painful to touch. Range of motion is limited. Palpation of the joint margin and patella is obscured. There is no muscle atrophy. Chronic synovitis and arthropathy. (a) Chronic synovitis of the right (R) knee is typified by a warm and swollen joint with reduced range of motion but no pain with palpation or motion. Palpation of the joint margins and patella are obscured by the spongy synovium, and muscle atrophy is present. (b) Radiograph of the knee showing narrowing of the joint space, erosions at the margins, sclerosis, osteoporosis, a widened intra-condylar notch and cyst formation. The development of arthropathy is directly linked to the number of joint bleeding episodes [8,9]. In the landmark Orthopaedic Outcome Study, which enrolled 378 patients with severe haemophilia A, Aledort et al. reported the Pettersson radiologic scores increased 1 point for every 40 joint bleeds [8]. A subsequent evaluation by Fischer et al. of 117 severe haemophilia patients found that far fewer bleeds – just 13 – were necessary to cause a 1 point increase in the Pettersson score [9]. Yet even this lower number may be an overestimate. A major limitation to the use of plain film radiographs as a tool for assessing arthropathy is their ability to visualize only gross arthritic alterations [1]. When magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on children with haemophilia who had no obvious clinical signs of arthropathy, early changes in the soft tissues (e.g., synovium and cartilage) were demonstrated [1]. These MRI findings indicate that incipient joint damage may occur after very few bleeding episodes. On-demand therapy (episodic factor replacement in response to acute bleeding events), while effective in controlling acute haemorrhage, cannot halt the ongoing joint destruction many patients with severe haemophilia A experience [10]. An epidemiologic survey conducted by the French Study Group of 116 haemophilia patients treated almost exclusively from birth with on-demand therapy found that at a mean age of 23 years, only 3.7% had normal joints by radiographic examination and 54.3% had undergone orthopaedic procedures [11]. Similarly dismal long-term outcomes were reported by Blanchette. Among patients with severe haemophilia managed in Canada with on-demand therapy, approximately 50% had evidence of joint disease by age 13 years; and by age 18, 24% of the 54 patients had undergone surgical synovectomy of at least 1 joint [12]. For children with severe haemophilia A and no evidence of inhibitors, the musculoskeletal complications that follow repeated joint bleeding can be effectively prevented with the early initiation of prophylaxis, the routine scheduled replacement of FVIII with the goal of maintaining FVIII trough levels above 1% [10,13–21]. Nonetheless, surveys of international practice patterns [22,23] and statistics from the Universal Data Collection Programme [24] indicate that the majority of patients with severe FVIII deficiency continue to receive on-demand therapy. In an effort to optimize outcomes in patients with severe haemophilia A through increasing the use of prophylaxis, a panel of clinicians from haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) in North America convened in Miami, Florida, on January 27–28, 2007, to review the current state of knowledge about joint-protective therapeutic approaches and from this derive best treatment strategies. We hope that the information presented in this supplement, which summarizes our review of the literature and subsequent discussions and recommendations, will help physicians and their staffs develop protocols for the use of prophylaxis in children, adolescents and adults with severe haemophilia A. We appreciate the opportunity to be guest editors of this CME supplement to Haemophilia and to work with our colleagues from the United States and Canada.

They reported that maintaining FVIII plasma levels between 1% and 3% of normal appeared to convert patients from a severe to a moderate haemophilia A phenotype, in which spontaneous bleeding events are less frequent and musculoskeletal complications are less likely to occur [25,26]. In the ensuing years, several observational studies demonstrated the efficacy of FVIII prophylaxis in preventing joint bleeding and the subsequent development of arthropathy, target joints and disability [8,13–20]. Moreover, the benefits of prophylaxis extended beyond joint protection and included preventing other serious or life-threatening haemorrhages, such as recurrent central nervous system bleeding following intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) [16,27], and indirectly improving academic performance [28] and quality of life (QOL) [19,20]. Because of these advantages, prophylaxis is recommended as optimal therapy for patients with severe haemophilia A by the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) [29], the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) [30] and the World Health Organization (WHO) [31].

Success criteria and epidemiology",European Journal Of Oral Sciences,1998.0,"The aim of this review was to offer a critical evaluation of the literature and to provide the clinician with scientifically-based diagnostic criteria for monitoring the implant condition. The review presents the current opinions on definitions of osseointegration and implant failure. Further, distinctions between failed and failing implants are discussed together with the presently used parameters to assess the implant status. Radiographic examinations together with implant mobility tests seem to be the most reliable parameters in the assessment of the prognosis for osseointegrated implants. On the basis of 73 published articles, the rates of early and late failures of Brånemark implants, used in various anatomical locations and clinical situations, were analyzed using a metanalytic approach. Biologically related implant failures calculated on a sample of 2,812 implants were relatively rare: 7.7% over a 5-year period (bone graft excluded). The predictability of implant treatment was remarkable, particularly for partially edentulous patients, who showed failure rates about half those of totally edentulous subjects. Our analysis also confirmed (for both early and late failures) the general trend of maxillas, having almost 3 times more implant losses than mandibles, with the exception of the partially edentulous situation which displayed similar failure rates both in upper and lower jaws. Surgical trauma together with anatomical conditions are believed to be the most important etiological factors for early implant losses (3.60% of 16,935 implants). The low prevalence of failures attributable to peri-implantitis found in the literature together with the fact that, in general, partially edentulous patients have less resorbed jaws, speak in favour of jaw volume, bone quality, and overload as the three major determinants for late implant failures in the Brånemark system. Conversely, the ITI system seemed to be characterized by a higher prevalence of losses due to peri-implantitis. These differences may be attributed to the different implant designs and surface characteristics. On the basis of the published literature, there appears to be a number of scientific issues which are yet not fully understood. Therefore, it is concluded that further clinical follow-up and retrieval studies are required in order to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms for failure of osseointegrated implants.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0
,10.1097/sla.0000000000001674,Advancing Surgical Outcomes Research and Quality Improvement Within an Enhanced Recovery Program Framework,Annals of Surgery,2016.0,"Surgical outcomes have been in increased focus during the last decades not only for humanitarian reasons but also as a prerequisite and potential driver to decrease health care costs. In this article, we want to argue that further improvements in surgical outcomes must stem from a combined approach that integrates quality improvement and surgical outcomes methodologies within the framework of updated, evidence-based perioperative practices (enhanced recovery programs). Most would agree that up-to-date outcome data are an essential basis for future improvements as ""without data on the present, you cannot improve in the future."" Consequently, many regional and national databases have been established around the world, with the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program being one of those with most outcome data combined with the necessary analysis of preoperative comorbidities. At the same time, the need for agreement for a uniform classification of surgical complications has been introduced by Clavien et al1 in a series of important articles and adapted by several other institutions. More recently, the Clavien group has refined the Clavien-Dindo classification index into the novel ""Comprehensive Complication Index,"" which measures surgical morbidity not only in relation to the most severe, but also to the total burden of complications. So far, so good. However, merely measuring outcomes may not be enough for improvement, as discussed in some recent provocative studies comparing institutions with and without the use of American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program or other outcome data. Consequently, such reports call for considerations on future strategies for improvement, but with a continued monitoring through existing well-proven collection of data.2 Firstly, an improved understanding of the perioperative pathophysiology and pathogenesis of postoperative organ dysfunction is a prerequisite for quality improvement,3,4 and where future research should define strategies for reduction of undesirable stress responses to the surgical injury. In this context, the classical endocrine-metabolic responses to surgery are mitigated by enhanced recovery programs.4 However, with regard to inflammatory responses and the complex immunological postinjury dysfunctions and their consequences for recovery,5 there is a need for interventional studies. So far, preoperative administration of a high-dose glucocorticoid is promising,6 but awaiting further procedure-specific outcome and safety data. Secondly, the introduction of a multimodal, multidisciplinary approach to enhance recovery (the ""fast-track"" methodology or ""enhanced recovery programs"") with a combination of improved surgical techniques including minimal invasive surgery, anesthetic and postoperative pain management, and optimized evidence-based perioperative care principles has led to improved surgical outcomes.3,4 In addition, a way forward may be to ask the basic simple questions ""why is the surgical patient in hospital today?"" or ""why is the surgical high-risk patient at risk?.""7 Such analyses made on a procedure-specific basis will allow the necessary detailed documentation of the patients' postoperative recovery problems, thereby serving as a basis for further improvement and reduction of morbidity. As an example, in hip and knee replacement often including elderly high-risk patients, these analyses have shown that pain, loss of quadriceps function, and orthostatic intolerance together with organizational issues are the key players and where subsequent focused interventions have led to improved recovery.8 However, several future challenges lie ahead for further improvement including optimized procedure-specific opioid-sparing analgesic programs, optimized fluid management including the concept of goal-directed fluid therapy, antiileus programs, organizational challenges with early reinstitution of mobilization to decrease the risk of thromboembolic and pulmonary complications, oral nutrition, and to facilitate rehabilitation programs where necessary.4 Other relevant outcomes may include risk of falls, readmissions, cognitive dysfunction, and so on.4 Similar efforts, such as the ""perioperative surgical home"" program, have been initiated in the US with initial findings as demonstrated within fast-track and enhanced recovery programs. Thirdly, although the benefits of enhanced recovery programs have been demonstrated and are continuously being developed,4 several key questions remain to be defined or answered. The first one being how to identify high-risk patients,7 thereby providing a basis for potential interventions such as intensified ward care or intensive care use. Secondly, there is a general agreement on the usefulness of predictive risk indices,9 but they have so far had little impact on outcomes, and the main question is whether existing predictive indices based on traditional care programs can be translated to institutions with implemented evidence-based updated enhanced recovery programs.4,7 In this context, a few well-defined fast-track programs have demonstrated that conventional risk factors such as diabetes, preoperative smoking, and alcohol use may have less impact than usually documented,10 calling for a reassessment of established risk assessment tools within a fast-track setting with concomitant reduced risk of postoperative organ dysfunctions. Finally, another important factor for future outcome studies is assessment of the timing of the complications (which comes first?).7 Thus, if the reason for staying in hospital is an initial ""medical"" complication such as cardiopulmonary, thromboembolic, fluid disturbance, paralytic ileus, and so on, the future strategy for improvement will be to further refine the fast-track methodology.3,4,7 On the other hand, if the initial postoperative event is a direct ""surgical"" complication such as wound dehiscence, major bleeding, anastomotic dehiscence, and so on, there is a subsequent risk of developing a ""medical"" complication.7 Consequently, the strategy would be to improve surgical technique.7 The focus on ""what comes first"" is important for future improvement as initial ""medical"" complications may increase the risk of a subsequent ""surgical"" complications and vice versa. Unfortunately, there is a lack of detailed large-scale studies for such stratification of surgical complications,7 thereby limiting interpretation of previous data with regards to strategies for future improvement. In conclusion, the future strategy for improving surgical outcomes will require studies with a combination of well-established and validated preoperative risk indices, with use of established complication score systems and considering what came first (""medical"" vs ""surgical"" complications), and within an enhanced recovery program framework with updated evidence-based care principles (Fig. 1). Finally, the approach needs a multidisciplinary collaborative effort.3,4,7 These combined strategies that integrate quality improvement, surgical outcomes methodologies, and updated enhanced recovery programs may together with other systems aiming at improving quality11 lead to a promising future for surgical outcomes",OpenAlex,0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,hemorrhage,none,2.5

The MELD which uses only objective variables was validated subsequently as an accurate predictor of survival among different populations of patients with advanced liver disease. The major use of the MELD score has been in allocation of organs for liver transplantation. However, the MELD score has also been shown to predict survival in patients with cirrhosis who have infections, variceal bleeding, as well as in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and alcoholic hepatitis. MELD may be used in selection of patients for surgery other than liver transplantation and in determining optimal treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are not candidates for liver transplantation. Despite the many advantages of the MELD score, there are approximately 15%-20% of patients whose survival cannot be accurately predicted by the MELD score. It is possible that the addition of variables that are better determinants of liver and renal function may improve the predictive accuracy of the model. Efforts at further refinement and validation of the MELD score will continue. (Hepatology 2007;45:797–805.)",OpenAlex,0,1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,8.5

These principles were derived by reviewing widely cited textbooks and articles describing the methods for performing economic analyses and by selecting the methods universally recommended.Main Results: Overall performance was only fair. Three articles adhered to all six principles, and the median number of principles to which articles adhered was three. Among the problems noted were failure to make underlying assumptions explicit and, therefore, verifiable, and failure to test assumptions with sensitivity analyses. No improvement in performance was observed between 1978 and 1987. Articles in general medical journals, however, were more likely to use analytic methods appropriately than articles in the general surgical or medical subspecialty literature.Conclusions:Greater attention should be devoted to ensuring the appropriate use of analytic methods for economic analyses, and readers should make note of the methods used when interpreting the results of economic analyses....References1.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IV TCC and no prior systemic chemotherapy were randomized to GC (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m 2 days 1, 8, and 15; cisplatin 70 mg/m 2 day 2) or standard MVAC every 28 days for a maximum of six cycles. RESULTS: Four hundred five patients were randomized (GC, n = 203; MVAC, n = 202). The groups were well-balanced with respect to prognostic factors. Overall survival was similar on both arms (hazards ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.32; P = .75), as were time to progressive disease (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.30), time to treatment failure (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.10), and response rate (GC, 49%; MVAC, 46%). More GC patients completed six cycles of therapy, with fewer dose adjustments. The toxic death rate was 1% on the GC arm and 3% on the MVAC arm. More GC than MVAC patients had grade 3/4 anemia (27% v 18%, respectively) and thrombocytopenia (57% v 21%, respectively). On both arms, the RBC transfusion rate was 13 of 100 cycles and grade 3/4 hemorrhage or hematuria was 2%; the platelet transfusion rate was four patients per 100 cycles and two patients per 100 cycles on GC and MVAC, respectively. More MVAC patients, compared with GC patients, had grade 3/4 neutropenia (82% v 71%, respectively), neutropenic fever (14% v 2%, respectively), neutropenic sepsis (12% v 1%, respectively), and grade 3/4 mucositis (22% v 1%, respectively) and alopecia (55% v 11%, respectively). Quality of life was maintained during treatment on both arms; however, more patients on GC fared better regarding weight, performance status, and fatigue. CONCLUSION: GC provides a similar survival advantage to MVAC with a better safety profile and tolerability. This better-risk benefit ratio should change the standard of care for patients with locally advanced and metastatic TCC from MVAC to GC.",OpenAlex,0,1,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,4.5

Now in its fifth edition, this document aims to provide guidance on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumatic injury and encourages adaptation of the guiding principles described here to individual institutional circumstances and resources. The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was founded in 2004, and the current author group included representatives of six relevant European professional societies. The group applied a structured, evidence-based consensus approach to address scientific queries that served as the basis for each recommendation and supporting rationale. Expert opinion and current clinical practice were also considered, particularly in areas in which randomised clinical trials have not or cannot be performed. Existing recommendations were re-examined and revised based on scientific evidence that has emerged since the previous edition and observed shifts in clinical practice. New recommendations were formulated to reflect current clinical concerns and areas in which new research data have been generated. Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of post-traumatic coagulopathy have supported improved management strategies, including evidence that early, individualised goal-directed treatment improves the outcome of severely injured patients. The overall organisation of the current guideline has been designed to reflect the clinical decision-making process along the patient pathway in an approximate temporal sequence. Recommendations are grouped behind the rationale for key decision points, which are patient- or problem-oriented rather than related to specific treatment modalities. While these recommendations provide guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of major bleeding and coagulopathy, emerging evidence supports the author group's belief that the greatest outcome improvement can be achieved through education and the establishment of and adherence to local clinical management algorithms. A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidance are key to improving patient outcomes. If incorporated into local practice, these clinical practice guidelines have the potential to ensure a uniform standard of care across Europe and beyond and better outcomes for the severely bleeding trauma patient.",OpenAlex,0,6,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,13.0

Markov regression modeling (adjusting for 11 covariates) was used in the evaluation of 198 mechanically ventilated patients to determine the probability of daily transition to delirium as a function of sedative and analgesic dose administration during the previous 24 h.Lorazepam was an independent risk factor for daily transition to delirium (odds ratio, 1.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.4]; P = 0.003), whereas fentanyl, morphine, and propofol were associated with higher but not statistically significant odds ratios. Increasing age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were also independent predictors of transitioning to delirium (multivariable P values < 0.05).Lorazepam administration is an important and potentially modifiable risk factor for transitioning into delirium even after adjusting for relevant covariates.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,general,none,0.0

Information regarding drug utilization and expenditures for prescribed drugs in the entire Swedish population was extracted from the first six months July-December 2005 and compared with total drug sales in the country including OTC and hospital use.The total quantity of drugs sold in Sweden was 2666 million DDDs, corresponding to 1608 DDD/1000 inhabitants daily. The total expenditures were 1.6 billion Euro. The prescribed drugs, included in the register, accounted for 84% of the total utilization and 77% of the total expenditures. About half of all men and two-thirds of all women in the country purchased drugs. The proportion increased by age. The most common drugs for chronic treatment were diuretics among women (8.8% of the population) and antithrombotic agents among men (7.6%). Psychotropic drugs, corticosteroids and analgesics were more common among women, while men used antithrombotic agents, antidiabetic drugs, lipid lowering agents and ACE inhibitors to a greater extent.The new register provides valuable data on exposure to drugs and is useful to study patterns of drug utilization.

,10.1177/0194599810389949,Clinical Practice Guideline: Tonsillectomy in Children,Otolaryngology,2010.0,"Objective Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530 000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, especially in relation to sleep‐disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence‐based recommendations on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years old under consideration for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children 1 to 18 years of age who may be candidates for tonsillectomy. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence‐based guidance in identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improve counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlight the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Results The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should administer a single, intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against clinicians routinely administering or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; (2) assessing the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or history of peritonsillar abscess; (3) asking caregivers of children with sleep‐disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; (4) counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a means to improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have tonsil hypertrophy and sleep‐disordered breathing; (5) counseling caregivers that sleep‐disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management; (6) advocating for pain management after tonsillectomy and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and reassessing pain; and (7) clinicians who perform tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage at least annually. The panel offered options to recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature &gt;38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A β‐hemolytic streptococcus.",OpenAlex,0,1,3,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,hemorrhage,6.0

The aim of this consensus is to provide support to the bedside clinician regarding the diagnosis, management and monitoring of shock. The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine invited 12 experts to form a Task Force to update a previous consensus (Antonelli et al.: Intensive Care Med 33:575–590, 2007). The same five questions addressed in the earlier consensus were used as the outline for the literature search and review, with the aim of the Task Force to produce statements based on the available literature and evidence. These questions were: (1) What are the epidemiologic and pathophysiologic features of shock in the intensive care unit? (2) Should we monitor preload and fluid responsiveness in shock? (3) How and when should we monitor stroke volume or cardiac output in shock? (4) What markers of the regional and microcirculation can be monitored, and how can cellular function be assessed in shock? (5) What is the evidence for using hemodynamic monitoring to direct therapy in shock? Four types of statements were used: definition, recommendation, best practice and statement of fact. Forty-four statements were made. The main new statements include: (1) statements on individualizing blood pressure targets; (2) statements on the assessment and prediction of fluid responsiveness; (3) statements on the use of echocardiography and hemodynamic monitoring. This consensus provides 44 statements that can be used at the bedside to diagnose, treat and monitor patients with shock.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

,10.2106/jbjs.21.01476,Recommendations from the ICM-VTE: Trauma,Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery,2022.0,"1 - What is the most optimal VTE prophylaxis in patients with multiple orthopaedic injuries? Response/Recommendation: Although multiple forms of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) with variable effectiveness are available for patients with multiple orthopedic injuries, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is considered the most optimal choice based on available literature. Strength of Recommendation: Acceptable. Delegates vote: Agree 86.36% Disagree 9.09% Abstain 4.55% (Strong Consensus). Rationale: VTE events following multiple orthopaedic injuries are associated with significant morbidity and mortality1,2. The prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in trauma patients without prophylactic treatment can reach up to 60%. Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a fatal form of VTE with prevalence ranging between 2 - 16%3,4. VTE can be prevented using different mechanical and chemical prophylaxis agents, therefore, significantly lower the burden on healthcare systems worldwide1. The aim of this review is to find the most optimal VTE prophylaxis in patients with multiple orthopaedic injuries. Multiple orthopaedic injuries rarely happen without extra-skeletal injuries, therefore, no studies in the current literature addressed VTE prophylaxis in patients with multiple orthopaedic injuries but without extra-skeletal injuries. Most of the available literature is addressing this patient population under different groups including, patients with trauma, poly-trauma, high energy fractures and lower extremity injuries1-3,5-7. The level of evidence varies among the reviewed literature, however, randomized controlled clinical trials in this subject are limited3,4. Based on our review, LMWH is considered the most optimal VTE prophylaxis in patients with multiple orthopaedic injuries1,3,5,6,8-14. Ley et al., recommends using LMWH due to its increased bioavailability, acceptably low bleeding complications and longer plasma half-life1. Rogers et al., published in their guidelines for prevention of VTE in trauma patients that LMWH has superior bioavailability when compared to low-dose heparin (LDH)5. Knudson et al., concluded in a prospective, randomized trial that LMWH is an extremely effective and safe method in preventing DVT in high-risk trauma patients15. Geerts et al., also concluded in a randomized double blinded study that LMWH was more effective than LDH in preventing VTE after major trauma16. Aggarwal et al., concluded in their guidelines for prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients with pelvis and acetabular fractures that LMWH is the preferred agent of choice8. In the updated Western Trauma Association (WTA) guidelines to reduce VTE in trauma patients1, LMWH was the recommended agent of choice for most trauma patients with a standard dose of 40 mg subcutaneously twice daily. However, in some cases such as obese patients, they recommended weight-based dosing at 0.5 mg to 0.6 mg/kg twice daily1. Timing of administration of LMWH is critical to achieve the optimal prophylaxis desired. It should be given to patients as soon as risk of bleeding is low to avoid complications1,3,11,17. According to Ley et al., pharmacologic prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible within 24 hours after injury1. Fondaparinux18 is a synthetic penta-saccharide drug that potentiates activity of antithrombin III that inhibits factor Xa. With a common dosage of 2.5 mg daily subcutaneously, this chemical prophylaxis showed promising results in elective orthopaedic surgery such as arthroplasty19. However, several issues have been raised to debate its safety in trauma patients18,20. Therefore, further studies are required to prove its safety and efficacy in trauma5. Another method of prophylaxis is the use of mechanical prophylaxis in form of pneumatic compression devices (PCD) which was promoted by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) work group practice management guidelines for the prevention of VTE in trauma patients3, especially in patients where chemical prophylaxis is contraindicated1,6-8,21. PCD can be used as an adjunct with chemical prophylaxis in moderate and high-risk patients1,10,22,23. The combination has shown lower incidence of symptomatic PE according to Ley et al1. High-risk patients include those with hemodynamic instability, active bleeding, and head trauma1,5,8. The use of mechanical prophylaxis without chemical prophylaxis in the absence of contraindication to chemical prophylaxis is not recommended according to multiple studies2,7. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are another form of prophylaxis against VTE4,24, although they are not without risk. It has an established role as an adjunct to LMWH in patients with DVT to prevent PE8. However, multiple studies recommend the use of IVC filters to be reserved for patients who cannot receive any form of prophylaxis or patients undergoing urgent surgery5,6,25. Khansarinia et al., concluded that insertion of IVC filter in multiply injured high-risk patients contributed to lower incidence and mortality rates of fatal and non-fatal PE24. Abdulaziz N. Aljurayyan, Ahmed A. Alabdali, Ryan K. Harrison 2 - What is the optimal VTE prophylaxis for polytrauma patients with both fractures and visceral injuries? Response/Recommendation: In patients with fractures and visceral injuries, anticoagulant-based thromboprophylaxis should be commenced as soon as bleeding risk allows. Bilateral mechanical thromboprophylaxis, if possible, should be administered to patients who are at high bleeding risk. Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Delegates vote: Agree 100.00% Disagree 0.00% Abstain 0.00% (Unanimous Strong Consensus). Rationale: Orthopaedic trauma patients frequently have concomitant visceral and/or brain injuries26-29. In general, major fractures significantly increase the risk of VTE in polytrauma30-35 while non-orthopaedic injuries (except spinal cord injuries) generally have a much lower impact on the risk of VTE associated with fractures36,37. Conversely, bleeding risk in patients with polytrauma is largely dictated by the presence of visceral and brain injuries. In polytrauma, VTE risk is relatively high38,39, and use of mechanical and/or chemical prophylaxis should be considered40-43. However, there is wide variability in thromboprophylaxis practice among orthopaedic trauma centers at least in part because of the paucity of direct evidence in this specific group44. Timing of the initiation of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis: In major trauma patients, the transition to a hypercoagulable state usually occurs early and is often seen at the time of admission45-47. Furthermore, numerous studies have shown that early initiation of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is associated with decreased risk of VTE in mixed trauma groups27,28,37,43,44 and in subgroups, including pelvic trauma45-48, spine fractures49-52, solid abdominal organ injuries53-56, and head injuries33,57,58. At the same time, bleeding complications were not shown to be increased with early anticoagulant prophylaxis in most studies33,37,43-46,48-55.

Methods: These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized, clinical trials and observational studies (1900 to September 2014) that reported clinical outcomes on patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic platelet transfusions. An expert panel reviewed the data and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Recommendation 1: The AABB recommends that platelets should be transfused prophylactically to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding in hospitalized adult patients with therapy-induced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. The AABB recommends transfusing hospitalized adult patients with a platelet count of 10 × 109 cells/L or less to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding. The AABB recommends transfusing up to a single apheresis unit or equivalent. Greater doses are not more effective, and lower doses equal to one half of a standard apheresis unit are equally effective. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence) Recommendation 2: The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 109 cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence) Recommendation 3: The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 × 109 cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence) Recommendation 4: The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having major elective nonneuraxial surgery with a platelet count less than 50 × 109 cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence) Recommendation 5: The AABB recommends against routine prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients who are nonthrombocytopenic and have cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The AABB suggests platelet transfusion for patients having bypass who exhibit perioperative bleeding with thrombocytopenia and/or evidence of platelet dysfunction.

Summary Background Data: AI is composed of various subfields that each provide potential solutions to clinical problems. Each of the core subfields of AI reviewed in this piece has also been used in other industries such as the autonomous car, social networks, and deep learning computers. Methods: A review of AI papers across computer science, statistics, and medical sources was conducted to identify key concepts and techniques within AI that are driving innovation across industries, including surgery. Limitations and challenges of working with AI were also reviewed. Results: Four main subfields of AI were defined: (1) machine learning, (2) artificial neural networks, (3) natural language processing, and (4) computer vision. Their current and future applications to surgical practice were introduced, including big data analytics and clinical decision support systems. The implications of AI for surgeons and the role of surgeons in advancing the technology to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed. Conclusions: Surgeons are well positioned to help integrate AI into modern practice. Surgeons should partner with data scientists to capture data across phases of care and to provide clinical context, for AI has the potential to revolutionize the way surgery is taught and practiced with the promise of a future optimized for the highest quality patient care.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,1.0

Since the development of guidelines is an expensive and time-consuming process, this Consensus may help to avoid duplication of effort in the future. It may also identify issues where the evidence is lacking and controlled studies are awaited.

The strategy to reach the Consensus involved five steps:

1. Two members of the GuiCom (VA and RE) identified four main topics: a) Diagnosis and follow-up; b) Score of endoscopic activity; c) Small bowel endoscopy; and d) Surveillance. During 2012 a call for participants to the Guideline was made to ECCO members. In addition, expert endoscopists recognised for their active research in the field were invited. Participants were selected by the Guicom and four working groups were created. Each working group had a chair (VA, MD, MT, and RE), two ECCO members including young members (Y-ECCO) and one experienced endoscopist. For the development of the guideline, relevant questions on separate topics were devised by the chairmen and their working parties. The questions were focused on current practice and areas of controversy. Participants of the Consensus process were asked to answer the questions based on evidence from the literature as well as their experience (Delphi procedure)3;

2. The working parties working in parallel performed a systematic literature search of their topic with the appropriate key words using Medline/Pubmed and the Cochrane database, as well as other relevant sources;

3. Provisional guideline statements on their topic were then written by the chairmen. These were circulated and commented on first by working party members and …",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,5.0

An alternative strategy for opening intracranial vessels during stroke is mechanical embolectomy, especially for patients ineligible for intravenous tPA.We investigated the safety and efficacy of a novel embolectomy device (Merci Retriever) to open occluded intracranial large vessels within 8 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms in a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter trial. All patients were ineligible for intravenous tPA. Primary outcomes were recanalization and safety, and secondary outcomes were neurological outcome at 90 days in recanalized versus nonrecanalized patients.Recanalization was achieved in 46% (69/151) of patients on intention to treat analysis, and in 48% (68/141) of patients in whom the device was deployed. This rate is significantly higher than that expected using an historical control of 18% (P<0.0001). Clinically significant procedural complications occurred in 10 of 141 (7.1%) patients. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages was observed in 11 of 141 (7.8%) patients.

,10.1002/hep.22772,Vascular disorders of the liver # †,Hepatology,2008.0,"This guideline has been approved by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and represents the position of the association. These recommendations provide a data-supported approach. They are based on the following: (1) formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic (Medline search); (2) American College of Physicians Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Guidelines1; (3) guideline policies, including the AASLD Policy on the Development and Use of Practice Guidelines and the American Gastroenterological Association Policy Statement on Guidelines2; and (4) the experience of the authors in the specified topic. Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information. To more fully characterize the quality of evidence supporting recommendations, the Practice Guidelines Committee of the AASLD requires a Class (reflecting benefit versus risk) and Level (assessing strength or certainty) of Evidence to be assigned and reported with each recommendation (Table 1, adapted from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association Practice Guidelines.3, 4) AASLD, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases; BCS, Budd-Chiari syndrome; CT, computed tomography; DVT, deep vein thrombosis; HHT, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; HV, hepatic vein; IVC, inferior vena cava; LVM, liver vascular malformation; MELD, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NRH, nodular regenerative hyperplasia; PVT, portal vein thrombosis; SOS, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome; TIPS, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt. The major vascular disorders of the liver are listed in Table 2. Most of the vascular disorders of the liver are rare, with the exception of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with cirrhosis, and therefore the best evidence about diagnosis and management has been acquired through prospective cohort studies rather than randomized clinical trials. Their importance lies in the very significant morbidity and mortality that can occur without timely diagnosis or disease-specific management or even with an inappropriate workup. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide clinicians with approaches to diagnose and manage the disorders for which there are sufficient data to make recommendations. Given the rarity of some of the vascular disorders, not all are suitable for practice guidelines, and these will not be discussed. These guidelines will review PVT, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), and congenital vascular malformations. Obstruction of the portal vein or its branches can be related to invasion or constriction by a malignant tumor, or to thrombosis. In developed countries, PVT might be more common than previously considered, as it was found at routine necropsy in about 1% of Swedish subjects in the 1970s.5 In developing countries, PVT has accounted for up to 30% and 75% of cases of portal hypertension in adults and children, respectively.6 From a clinical point of view, PVT consists of two different entities, acute PVT and chronic PVT, which represent successive stages of the same disease and share similar causes, but differ as to their management.7 Therefore, after considering their common causal factors, acute and chronic PVT will be discussed successively. Likewise, PVT occurring in children, in patients with cirrhosis, and in liver transplant recipients will be considered separately, because their features and management differ from those in other groups of patients. PVT is caused by a combination of local and general risk factors. A local risk factor can be identified in about 30% of patients, and a general risk factor in 70%.7-11 A list of these local risk factors is provided in Table 3. Malignant tumors within the portal venous territory (in the absence of portal venous invasion or constriction), and cirrhosis are the leading local risk factors for PVT.5, 9 In the rest of the patients, the most common local factor for PVT is inflammatory foci in the abdomen.7, 12, 13 A local factor for PVT is more frequently recognized at the acute stage of PVT than later on at the chronic stage.7 General risk factors are similar in nature and in prevalence in patients with acute PVT and chronic PVT.7 As shown in Table 4, an inherited or acquired prothrombotic condition has been found in many patients with PVT, whether a local risk factor had been identified.8, 9, 11, 14-19 Therefore, identification of a local risk factor does not exclude the possibility that a general risk factor is present. Malignancy is a well-established, although not fully understood, risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).20 This malignancy-associated prothrombotic state may play a role in PVT developing in patients with malignant abdominal tumors in the absence of compression or invasion. Likewise, systemic inflammatory response is a major general risk factor for thrombosis.21 In the context of acute PVT, however, it is difficult to determine whether inflammation is a cause or consequence of PVT. In young adults without cancer or cirrhosis, PVT is frequently the presenting manifestation of a myeloproliferative disease.11, 22 Overall, 30%–40% of patients with PVT are affected with chronic, Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative diseases, usually polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or unclassified myeloproliferative diseases. However, due to portal hypertension and/or iron deficiency, the peripheral blood changes suggestive for a myeloproliferative disease are lacking in most affected patients.23 Furthermore, splenic enlargement is not specific for a diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease in a context of portal hypertension. Clusters of dystrophic megakaryocytes at bone marrow biopsy22 and endogenous erythroid colony formation in culture of bone marrow or circulating progenitors23 have been used in the past to make a diagnosis of occult or masked myeloproliferative disease. Recently, 1849G→1849T point mutation (V617F) of the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene in myeloid cells has proved a highly specific and easily detectable marker for myeloproliferative disease. Among 388 patients with noncancerous, noncirrhotic PVT in four studies, this mutation was found in 21%–37% of patients with PVT.24-27 However, in 5%–10% of patients with PVT, this specific mutation was undetectable whereas bone marrow biopsy and assessment",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,3.0

The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) process and independent ethics protocols were used. Sources of data included original and published systematic reviews; randomized, controlled trials; and abstracts up to October 2008. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations have been rated by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Recommendations emphasize early risk stratification, by using validated prognostic scales, and early endoscopy (within 24 hours). Endoscopic hemostasis remains indicated for high-risk lesions, whereas data support attempts to dislodge clots with hemostatic, pharmacologic, or combination treatment of the underlying stigmata. Clips or thermocoagulation, alone or with epinephrine injection, are effective methods; epinephrine injection alone is not recommended. Second-look endoscopy may be useful in selected high-risk patients but is not routinely recommended. Preendoscopy proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may downstage the lesion; intravenous high-dose PPI therapy after successful endoscopic hemostasis decreases both rebleeding and mortality in patients with high-risk stigmata. Although selected patients can be discharged promptly after endoscopy, high-risk patients should be hospitalized for at least 72 hours after endoscopic hemostasis. For patients with UGIB who require a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a PPI with a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor is preferred to reduce rebleeding. Patients with UGIB who require secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis should start receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) again as soon as cardiovascular risks outweigh gastrointestinal risks (usually within 7 days); ASA plus PPI therapy is preferred over clopidogrel alone to reduce rebleeding.",OpenAlex,0,2,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,hemorrhage,none,11.0

Objective: To examine the baseline and time-dependent risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia and to determine the conditional probability and cumulative risk over the duration of stay in the intensive care unit. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: 16 intensive care units in Canada. Patients: 1014 mechanically ventilated patients. Measurements: Demographic and time-dependent variables reflecting illness severity, ventilation, nutrition, and drug exposure. Pneumonia was classified by using five methods: adjudication committee, bedside clinician's diagnosis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition, Clinical Pulmonary Infection score, and positive culture from bronchoalveolar lavage or protected specimen brush. Results: 177 of 1014 patients (17.5%) developed ventilator-associated pneumonia 9.0 ± 5.9 days (median, 7 days [interquartile range, 5 to 10 days]) after admission to the intensive care unit. Although the cumulative risk increased over time, the daily hazard rate decreased after day 5 (3.3% at day 5, 2.3% at day 10, and 1.3% at day 15).

Exposure to antibiotics conferred protection (risk ratio, 0.37 [CI, 0.27 to 0.51]). Independent risk factors were the same regardless of the pneumonia definition used. Conclusions: The daily risk for pneumonia decreases with increasing duration of stay in the intensive care unit.

Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. ▸ While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion.▸ Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of the brain injury spectrum.▸ Animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. ▸ Experimental evidence suggests the concussed brain is less responsive to usual neural activation and when premature cognitive or physical activity occurs before complete recovery the brain may be vulnerable to prolonged dysfunction.▸ It is estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions occur in the USA per year during competitive sports and recreational activities; however, as many as 50% of the concussions may go unreported. ▸ Concussions occur in all sports with the highest incidence in football, hockey, rugby, soccer and basketball. RISK FACTORS FOR SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION: ▸ A history of concussion is associated with a higher risk of sustaining another concussion. ▸ A greater number, severity and duration of symptoms after a concussion are predictors of a prolonged recovery. ▸ In sports with similar playing rules, the reported incidence of concussion is higher in female athletes than in male athletes. ▸ Certain sports, positions and individual playing styles have a greater risk of concussion. ▸ Youth athletes may have a more prolonged recovery and are more susceptible to a concussion accompanied by a catastrophic injury. ▸ Preinjury mood disorders, learning disorders, attention-deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD) and migraine headaches complicate diagnosis and management of a concussion.▸ Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis ideally made by a healthcare provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in the recognition and evaluation of concussion. ▸ Graded symptom checklists provide an objective tool for assessing a variety of symptoms related to concussions, while also tracking the severity of those symptoms over serial evaluations. ▸ Standardised assessment tools provide a helpful structure for the evaluation of concussion, although limited validation of these assessment tools is available.▸ Any athlete suspected of having a concussion should be stopped from playing and assessed by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. ▸ Recognition and initial assessment of a concussion should be guided by a symptoms checklist, cognitive evaluation (including orientation, past and immediate memory, new learning and concentration), balance tests and further neurological physical examination. ▸ While standardised sideline tests are a useful framework for examination, the sensitivity, specificity, validity and reliability of these tests among different age groups, cultural groups and settings is largely undefined. Their practical usefulness with or without an individual baseline test is also largely unknown. ▸ Balance disturbance is a specific indicator of a concussion, but not very sensitive. Balance testing on the sideline may be substantially different than baseline tests because of differences in shoe/cleat-type or surface, use of ankle tape or braces, or the presence of other lower extremity injury. ▸ Imaging is reserved for athletes where intracerebral bleeding is suspected. ▸ There is no same day RTP for an athlete diagnosed with a concussion. ▸ Athletes suspected or diagnosed with a concussion should be monitored for deteriorating physical or mental status.▸ Neuropsychological (NP) tests are an objective measure of brain-behaviour relationships and are more sensitive for subtle cognitive impairment than clinical exam. ▸ Most concussions can be managed appropriately without the use of NP testing. ▸ Computerised neuropsychological (CNP) testing should be interpreted by healthcare professionals trained and familiar with the type of test and the individual test limitations, including a knowledgeable assessment of the reliable change index, baseline variability and false-positive and false-negative rates. ▸ Paper and pencil NP tests can be more comprehensive, test different domains and assess for other conditions which may masquerade as or complicate assessment of concussion. ▸ NP testing should be used only as part of a comprehensive concussion management strategy and should not be used in isolation. ▸ The ideal timing, frequency and type of NP testing have not been determined. ▸ In some cases, properly administered and interpreted NP testing provides an added value to assess cognitive function and recovery in the management of sports concussions. ▸ It is unknown if use of NP testing in the management of sports concussion helps prevent recurrent concussion, catastrophic injury or long-term complications. ▸ Comprehensive NP evaluation is helpful in the post-concussion management of athletes with persistent symptoms or complicated courses.▸ Students will require cognitive rest and may require academic accommodations such as reduced workload and extended time for tests while recovering from a concussion.▸ Concussion symptoms should be resolved before returning to exercise. ▸ A RTP progression involves a gradual, step-wise increase in physical demands, sports-specific activities and the risk for contact. ▸ If symptoms occur with activity, the progression should be halted and restarted at the preceding symptom-free step. ▸ RTP after concussion should occur only with medical clearance from a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions.

The International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC scoring system provides objective measurement of DIC. Where DIC is present the scoring system correlates with key clinical observations and outcomes. It is important to repeat the tests to monitor the dynamically changing scenario based on laboratory results and clinical observations. The cornerstone of the treatment of DIC is treatment of the underlying condition. Transfusion of platelets or plasma (components) in patients with DIC should not primarily be based on laboratory results and should in general be reserved for patients who present with bleeding. In patients with DIC and bleeding or at high risk of bleeding (e.g. postoperative patients or patients due to undergo an invasive procedure) and a platelet count of <50 x 10(9)/l transfusion of platelets should be considered. In non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not given unless it is perceived that there is a high risk of bleeding. In bleeding patients with DIC and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be useful. It should not be instituted based on laboratory tests alone but should be considered in those with active bleeding and in those requiring an invasive procedure. There is no evidence that infusion of plasma stimulates the ongoing activation of coagulation. If transfusion of FFP is not possible in patients with bleeding because of fluid overload, consider using factor concentrates such as prothrombin complex concentrate, recognising that these will only partially correct the defect because they contain only selected factors, whereas in DIC there is a global deficiency of coagulation factors. Severe hypofibrinogenaemia (<1 g/l) that persists despite FFP replacement may be treated with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. In cases of DIC where thrombosis predominates, such as arterial or venous thromboembolism, severe purpura fulminans associated with acral ischemia or vascular skin infarction, therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered. In these patients where there is perceived to be a co-existing high risk of bleeding there may be benefits in using continuous infusion unfractionated heparin (UFH) due to its short half-life and reversibility. Weight adjusted doses (e.g. 10 mu/kg/h) may be used without the intention of prolonging the APTT ratio to 1.5-2.5 times the control. Monitoring the APTT in these cases may be complicated and clinical observation for signs of bleeding is important. In critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism with prophylactic doses of heparin or low molecular weight heparin is recommended. Consider treating patients with severe sepsis and DIC with recombinant human activated protein C (continuous infusion, 24 microg/kg/h for 4 d). Patients at high risk of bleeding should not be given recombinant human activated protein C. Current manufacturers guidance advises against using this product in patients with platelet counts of <30 x 10(9)/l. In the event of invasive procedures, administration of recombinant human activated protein C should be discontinued shortly before the intervention (elimination half-life approximately 20 min) and may be resumed a few hours later, dependent on the clinical situation. In the absence of further prospective evidence from randomised controlled trials confirming a beneficial effect of antithrombin concentrate on clinically relevant endpoints in patients with DIC and not receiving heparin, administration of antithrombin cannot be recommended. In general, patients with DIC should not be treated with antifibrinolytic agents. Patients with DIC that is characterised by a primary hyperfibrinolytic state and who present with severe bleeding could be treated with lysine analogues, such as tranexamic acid (e.g. 1 g every 8 h).",OpenAlex,0,13,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,22.5

A key part of a systematic review of prediction models is examination of risk of bias and applicability to the intended population and setting. To help reviewers with this process, the authors developed PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool) for studies developing, validating, or updating (for example, extending) prediction models, both diagnostic and prognostic. PROBAST was developed through a consensus process involving a group of experts in the field. It includes 20 signaling questions across 4 domains (participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis). This explanation and elaboration document describes the rationale for including each domain and signaling question and guides researchers, reviewers, readers, and guideline developers in how to use them to assess risk of bias and applicability concerns. All concepts are illustrated with published examples across different topics. The latest version of the PROBAST checklist, accompanying documents, and filled-in examples can be downloaded from www.probast.org.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,6.0

For this issue, we proposed a new sensor array optimization algorithm named Interfered Feature Elimination coupled with Feature Group Selection (IFE-FGS). In this method, the IFE algorithm first removed the bad sensor features; then the FGS algorithm determined the optimized sensor combination by gradually selecting the features in groups. The experimental results show the superiority of the IFE- FGS method on two bacteria datasets and six public gene expression profiling datasets. IFE- FGS achieves the classification accuracy of 93.95% and 94.94% in mean accuracy and max accuracy, respectively, on the bacteria dataset 2, which is significantly ahead of the comparison methods. Besides, our proposed method shows consistency and effectiveness. It achieves excellent performance, which takes two first-places, four second-places in mean accuracy, one first-place, and six second-places in max accuracy.

Infection, usually due to bacterial colonization, significantly complicates this process by hindering the course of healing and enhancing the chances of systemic complications. Recent advances in wearable biosensors have transformed wound care by making real-time monitoring of biomarkers such as pH, temperature, moisture, and infection-related metabolites like trimethylamine and uric acid. This review focuses on recent advances in biosensor technologies designed for wound management. Novel sensor architectures, such as flexible and stretchable electronics, colorimetric patches, and electrochemical platforms, enable the non-invasive detection of changes associated with wounds with high specificity and sensitivity. These are increasingly combined with AI and analytics based on smartphones that can enable timely and personalized interventions. Examples are the PETAL patch sensor that applies multiple sensing mechanisms for wide-ranging views on wound status and closed-loop systems that connect biosensors to therapeutic devices to automate infection control. Additionally, self-powered biosensors that tap into body heat or energy from the biofluids themselves avoid any external batteries and are thus more effective in field use or with limited resources. Internet of Things connectivity allows further support for remote sharing and monitoring of data, thus supporting telemedicine applications. Although wearable biosensors have developed relatively rapidly and their prospects continue to expand, regular clinical application is stalled by significant challenges such as regulatory, cost, patient compliance, and technical problems related to sensor accuracy, biofouling, and power, among others, that need to be addressed by innovative solutions. The goal of this review is to synthesize current trends, challenges, and future directions in wound healing and infection monitoring, with emphasis on the potential for wearable biosensors to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare burdens.

Physicians face the challenge to find single, extremely rare PAD patients/families among the millions of individuals with common allergic diseases. We describe case scenarios with signature PAD. We review the literature and deduct specific clinical red flags for PAD detection. They include a positive family history and/or signs of pathological susceptibility to infections, immunodysregulation, or syndromic disease. Results of conventional laboratory and most immunological lab studies are not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of PAD. In the past, multistep narrowing of differential diagnoses by various immunological and other laboratory tests led to testing of single genes or gene panel analyses, which was a time-consuming and often unsuccessful approach. The implementation of whole-genomic analyses in the routine diagnostics has led to a paradigm shift. Upfront genome-wide analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS) will shorten the time to diagnosis, save patients from unnecessary investigations, and reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose a rational, clinical landmark-based approach for deciding which cases pass the filter for carrying out early WGS. WGS result interpretation requires a great deal of caution regarding the causal relationship of variants in PAD phenotypes and absence of proof by adequate functional tests. In case of negative WGS results, a re-iteration attitude with re-analyses of the data (using the latest data base annotation)) may eventually lead to PAD diagnosis. PAD, like many other rare genetic diseases, will only be successfully managed, if physicians from different clinical specialties and geneticists interact regularly in multidisciplinary conferences.",PubMed,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0

According to this consensus definition, the diagnosis of FRI is based on preoperative and intraoperative suggestive or confirmatory criteria. Serum markers, histology, and microbiological cultures are considered to play a crucial role in the FRI diagnostic pathway. However, at the time of publication of the FRI consensus definition in 2018 and its update in 2020, limited data was available on the accuracy of these diagnostic methods. This review aims to provide an overview of recent publications and discuss whether new evidence has been obtained regarding the value of these current diagnostic techniques. Meanwhile, several studies have confirmed the limited prognostic value of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation ratio, and white blood cell count. Other serologic markers for preoperative diagnosis of FRI with promising diagnostic performance are d-dimer, plasma fibrinogen, platelet count to mean platelet volume ratio, and a risk prediction model that includes soft tissue injury type and fracture complexity in addition to blood markers. However, their true diagnostic value in daily clinical practice needs to be investigated in further studies. Data on histology in FRI diagnosis is still limited, but its potential as a confirmatory criterion seems to lie in its high specificity. Recent studies indicate that tissue culture exhibits moderate sensitivity and high specificity, with sensitivity improvements achieved by sampling of five specimens and long-term culture. Implant sonication also appears to enhance the sensitivity of culture and the detection rate of polymicrobial infections. In conclusion, the true value of diagnostic techniques is difficult to assess, in part because it is measured against a gold standard that is itself imperfect and still evolving, but also because of methodological differences in sample processing or the use of different thresholds. Nevertheless, this review has identified that the value of current diagnostic techniques is high when used in combination.

Although bacteria are an important cause of chronic nonhealing wounds, fungi also play a substantial role in them. The fungal infection rate varies with different chronic wound types, but overall, the prevalence of fungi is extremely underestimated in the clinical treatment and management of chronic wounds. Wounds and ulcers can be colonized by host cutaneous, commensal or environmental fungi and evolve into local infections, causing fungemia as well as invasive fungal disease. Furthermore, the fungi involved in nonhealing wound-related infections help commensal bacteria resist antibiotics and the host immune response, forcing wounds to become reservoirs for multiresistant species, which are considered a potential key factor in the microbial bioburden of wounds and ulcers. Fungi can be recalcitrant to the healing process. Biofilm establishment is the predominant mechanism of fungal resistance or tolerance to antimicrobials in chronic nonhealing wounds.

The low surgical resection rate and chemotherapy sensitivity result in dismal survival. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity to accurately assess the prognosis of GC patients. In the present study, 3385 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from the single-cell RNA sequencing data of GC specimens. Using the unsupervised dimensionality reduction, we further found 3 subsets of cells including gastric cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and memory T cells. Based on the cell clustering, we explored the key regulatory genes for GC progression by pseudo-time analysis and functional enrichment analysis. According to the results, the significant differentially expressed fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1) verified by pseudo-time analysis was identified as the hub gene of GC progression. FABP1 was shown to be closely related to the long-term survival and the age at diagnosis of patients with GC in analysis based on the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. To further verify the role of FABP1 in GC, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using the GC tissue microarray and found that the expression level of FABP1 was higher in GC tissues than in the adjacent tissues. Moreover, GC patients with higher expression of FABP1 had a worse clinical outcome. In summary, our study revealed that FABP1 is a potential effective biomarker for the prognosis of GC, and high expression of FABP1 predicts unsatisfactory survival.",PubMed,0,0,1,0,0,3,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,12.5

Though prevention is of utmost importance in PJI management, the last decade has seen many remarkable developments in PJI diagnosis, including the introduction of several standardized PJI diagnostic definitions and biomarkers. Depending on the specific clinical situation, a myriad of treatment options for PJI are offered. Our review aims to summarize the pertinent information on PJI diagnosis and synthesize literature on the different treatment methods currently used in clinical practice. One of the most accepted PJI diagnostic definitions was developed by the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) in 2011, later modified in the 2013 International Consensus Meeting (ICM). After promising results from studies, alpha-defensins and D-dimer were recently incorporated into the 2018 ICM PJI definition. The management choices for PJI include irrigation and debridement (DAIR), one-stage exchange arthroplasty, or two-stage exchange arthroplasty, to name a few. While two-stage revision has traditionally been the treatment of choice in the United States, there has been a growing body of evidence framing one-stage revision as a comparable choice. One-stage revision should be offered in patients meeting strict selection criteria: no sinus tract, proper soft tissue available for wound closure, appropriate bone stock, a favorable identifiable organism with encouraging antibiotic sensitivities (for cement and oral suppression later), and robust immunological status. DAIR can be considered in case of early infections with sensitive infecting organisms. Patients with multiple unsuccessful revisions or those who refuse further surgical intervention for PJI can be offered antibiotic suppression. If nothing seems to work, salvage procedures (resection arthroplasty and arthrodesis) are available as a last resort.

Technology is available that can detect genetic markers of resistance, but they are not all encompassing, and often require specialized facilities that can detect less common genetic markers. Newer antimicrobials can help combat MDROs, but additional resistance patterns may evolve during treatment. Considering drug shortages and antimicrobial formularies, clinicians must remain vigilant when treating infections. This case report describes the development of resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam in a burn patient. The patient was a 54-year-old burn victim with a 58% total body surface area (TBSA) thermal burn who underwent multiple courses of antibiotics for various Pseudomonal infections. The initial Pseudomonal wound infection was sensitive to cefepime, aminoglycosides, and meropenem. A subsequent resistant pseudomonal pneumonia was treated with ceftazidime-avibactam 2.5 g every 6 hours due to the elevated MIC to cefepime (16 mcg/mL) and meropenem (>8 mcg/mL). Although the patient improved over 7 days, the patient again spiked fevers and had increased white blood counts (WBC). Repeat blood cultures demonstrated a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to ceftazidime-avibactam of 16 mcg/mL, which is above the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoint of 8 mcg/mL.

However, current diagnostic tools are neither optimal nor widely available. The availability of a test detecting circulating biomarkers would considerably improve CE diagnosis and cyst staging (active vs inactive), as well as treatments and follow-up of patients. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles involved in intercellular communication, including immune system responses, and are a recognized source of biomarkers. With the aim of identifying potential biomarkers, plasma pools from patients infected by active or inactive CE, as well as from control subjects, were processed to isolate exosomes for proteomic label-free quantitative analysis. Results were statistically processed and subjected to bioinformatics analysis to define distinct features associated with parasite viability. First, a few parasite proteins were identified that were specifically associated with either active or inactive CE, which represent potential biomarkers to be validated in further studies. Second, numerous identified proteins of human origin were common to active and inactive CE, confirming an overlap of several immune response pathways. However, a subset of human proteins specific to either active or inactive CE, and central in the respective protein-protein interaction networks, were identified. These include the Src family kinases Src and Lyn, and the immune-suppressive cytokine TGF-β in active CE, and Cdc42 in inactive CE. The Src and Lyn Kinases were confirmed as potential markers of active CE in totally independent plasma pools. In addition, insights were obtained on immune response profiles: largely consistent with previous evidence, our observations hint to a Th1/Th2/regulatory immune environment in patients with active CE and a Th1/inflammatory environment with a component of the wound healing response in the presence of inactive CE.

Injury to the liver, the largest solid organ in the body, leads to a cascade of inflammatory events. Chronic inflammation leads to the activation of hepatic stellate cells that undergo trans-differentiation to become myofibroblasts, the main extra-cellular matrix producing cells in the liver; over time increased extra-cellular matrix production results in the formation of liver fibrosis. Although fibrogenesis may be viewed as having evolved as a ""wound healing"" process that preserves tissue integrity, sustained chronic fibrosis can become pathogenic culminating in CLD, cirrhosis and its associated complications. As the reference standard for detecting liver fibrosis, liver biopsy, is invasive and has an associated morbidity, the diagnostic assessment of CLD by non-invasive testing is attractive. Accordingly, in this review the mechanisms by which liver inflammation and fibrosis develop in chronic liver diseases are explored to identify appropriate and meaningful diagnostic targets for clinical practice. Due to differing disease prevalence and treatment efficacy, disease specific diagnostic targets are required to optimally manage individual CLDs such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic hepatitis C infection. To facilitate this, a review of the pathogenesis of both conditions is also conducted.

Although physicians currently rely on clinical signs along with non-specific biomarkers of infection, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, to diagnose and monitor DFU, there is no specific and sensitive measure available to monitor or prognosticate the success of foot salvage therapy (FST). To address this we performed a prospective, observational microbiome analysis to test the hypotheses that: (i) the initial microbiomes of healed versus non-healed DFU are distinct; (ii) the microbial load, diversity and presence of pathogenic organism of the DFU change in response to antibiotics treatment; and (iii) the changes in the DFU microbiome during treatment are prognostic of clinical outcome. To test this, microbiome analyses were performed on 23 DFU patients undergoing FST, in which wound samples were collected at zero, four, and eight weeks following wound debridement and antibiotics treatment. Bacterial abundance was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Eleven patients healed their DFU, while FDT failed to heal DFU in the other 12 patients. Microbiome results demonstrated that healing DFUs had a larger abundance Actinomycetales and Staphylococcaceae (p < 0.05), while DFUs that did not heal had a higher abundance of Bacteroidales and Streptococcaceae (p < 0.05). FST marked increases Actinomycetales in DFU, and this increase is significantly greater in patients that healed (p < 0.05). Future studies to confirm the differential microbiomes, and that increasing Actinomycetales is prognostic of successful FST are warranted. Statement of Clinical Significance: Tracking changes in the prevalence of pathogens in diabetic foot ulcers may be a clinical tool for monitoring treatment response to foot salvage therapy and prognosticating the need for further surgical intervention. The initial wound sample microbiome may provide important prognostic information on the eventual clinical outcome of foot salvage therapy. It may serve as an important clinical tool for patient counseling and making surgical decision of pursuing foot salvage versus amputation. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) biofilms were exposed to ES, ciprofloxacin, or both, with efficacy assessed and quantified by fluorescence staining, enumeration, metabolic assays, and biomass quantification; VOCs were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In vitro MSSA and PA and ex vivo PA biofilms exposed to ES showed significantly reduced bacterial viability, metabolic activity, and biomass compared to controls (p < 0.05). There was significant variation in the relative abundance of VOCs in in vitro MSSA and PA and in ex vivo PA biofilms exposed to ES and antibiotic (p < 0.05). 2-methyl-1-propanol was associated with MSSA viability (R = 0.93, p < 0.05), biomass (R = 0.97, p < 0.05), and metabolic activity (R = 0.93, p < 0.05) and 3-methyl-1-butanol was associated with PA biomass (R = 0.93, p < 0.05). We showed that ES and VOC biomarkers are possible options for alternative nonpharmacological antimicrobial management of biofilms and noninvasive monitoring of wound infection treatment responses, respectively.",PubMed,0,0,5,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,antimicrobial,9.5

However, currently, there is a paucity in the orthopaedics literature investigating the relationship between nutritional status and wound complications following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of (1) postoperative infections, (2) wound complications, (3) concomitant infection with wound (CoIW) complication, and (4) infection followed by wound complication by using (1) albumin, (2) prealbumin, and (3) transferrin levels as indicators of nutritional status. These four different outcome measures were chosen as they are encountered commonly in daily clinical practice. A retrospective review of a national private payer database for patients who underwent TKA with postoperative infections and wound complications stratified by preoperative serum albumin (normal: 3.5-5 g/dL), prealbumin (normal: 16-35 mg/dL), and transferrin levels (normal: 200-360 mg/dL) between 2007 and 2015 was conducted. Patients were identified by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), International Classification of Disease, ninth revision (ICD-9) codes, and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). Linear regression was performed to evaluate changes over times. Yearly rates of infection, as well as a correlation and odds ratio analysis of nutritional laboratory values to postoperative complications, were also performed. Our query returned a total of 161,625 TKAs, of which 11,047 (7%) had postoperative wound complications, 18,403 (11%) had infections, 6,296 (34%) had CoIW, and 4,877 (4%) patients with infection developed wound complications. Albumin was the most commonly ordered laboratory test when assessing complications (96%). Wound complications, infections, CoIW, and infection with wound complications after were higher in those below the normal range: albumin <3.5 g/dL (9, 14, 6, and 5%), prealbumin <15 mg/dL (20, 23, 13, and 12%), and transferrin <200 mg/dL (12, 17, 6, and 6%). Preoperative albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin values falling below the normal range represented an increased risk for postoperative complications. Those patients who were in the normal range, however, did not have an increased risk. Therefore, our results suggest that preoperative nutritional optimization can play an important role in reducing the risk for postoperative complications.",PubMed,0,0,6,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,10.0

,10.1111/wrr.12396,Wound healing society 2015 update on guidelines for pressure ulcers,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2015.0,"The Wound Healing Society guidelines for the treatment of pressure ulcers were originally published in 2006. These guidelines provided recommendations, along with their respective levels of evidence and strength on various categories. Over the last seven years, a great deal of literature regarding these aspects of pressure ulcer management has been published. An advisory panel comprised of academicians, clinicians, and researchers was chosen to update the 2006 guidelines. Members included vascular surgeons, internists, plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, dermatologists, emergency medicine physicians, and registered nurses, all with expertise in wound healing. The goal of this article is to evaluate relevant new findings, upon which an updated version of the guidelines will be based. In 2006, in an effort to develop guidelines that were could provide clinicians with a reasonable approach to caring for patients, even in the absence of high quality human data, the Wound Healing Society developed guidelines using a different approach to evidence citations and past approaches to evidence-based guidelines. Most past approaches relied only on publications regarding clinical human studies. Laboratory or animal studies were not cited. We have used well-controlled animal studies that present proof of principle, especially when a clinical series corroborated the laboratory results. Because of this variation, a different system was used to grade the weight of evidence supporting a given guideline. The strength of evidence supporting a guideline is listed as Level I, Level II, or Level III. The guideline levels were: Level I: Meta-analysis of multiple RCTs or at least two RCTs supporting the intervention of the guideline. Another route would be multiple laboratory or animal experiments with at least two clinical series supporting the laboratory results. Level II: Less than Level I, but at least one RCT and at least two significant clinical series or expert opinion papers with literature reviews supporting the intervention. Experimental evidence that is quite convincing, but not yet supported by adequate human experience. Level III: Suggestive data of proof of principle, but lacking sufficient data such as meta-analysis, RCT, or multiple clinical series. Since the 2006 guidelines, we sought to capture the highest quality of literature available regarding pressure ulcer diagnosis and treatment using a key word search of Pubed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Similarly, the citations of relevant articles were examined by hand. Key terms were generated from the existing guidelines. In this search as opposed to the previous data collection prior to 2006, we used human and disease specific data and limited to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective series reviews, clinical case series, and expert panel recommendations published between January 2006 and present. References prior to 2006 supporting the original guideline recommendations are not included. Therefore, in some cases no additional updated references were included and the support for the guideline recommendation is based on evidence presented in the 2006 guideline. Therefore, no updated references are presented. It was further limited to only English publications. Any relevant additional references found after the formal search were also included. The findings of these articles have been divided into one or more of the appropriate categories as performed in the original guideline. Each of the guidelines underwent a Delphi consensus among the panel members. Each set was critically evaluated by all panel members. There was a consensus of at least 10 panel members on each individual guideline. The first draft was of the guidelines was presented in 2014 for public comment and subsequent drafts revised based on those comments. The majority of the guidelines had unanimous concurrence. The resultant guidelines for the treatment of pressure ulcers are attached. These are guidelines for treatment. They are intended to guide wound caretakers in choosing the best available options. They are NOT meant to be standards of care. Evidence reference: Preamble: Pressure and compression to soft tissue plays a role in the etiology of pressure ulcers. Patient positioning and selection of support surfaces to reduce pressure-related tissue damage are recognized as important components of a comprehensive treatment strategy. While there are limited definitive studies, the best current evidence and expert opinion suggest the following guidelines: Guideline # 1.1: Establish a repositioning schedule and avoid positioning patients on pressure ulcers and bony prominences. (Level II—no change) Principle: Pressure ulcers are thought to result from hypoperfusion to soft tissues. Compression of soft tissues against a bony prominence may contribute to hypoperfusion. It is reasonable to assume that pressure on an ulcer may result in delayed healing. Patients should be repositioned to relieve pressure over bony prominences. The exact turning interval is not known and is derived empirically. Reductions in pressure ulcers have been achieved, but positioning is not universally effective. Updated Evidence: Guideline #1.2 (revised): Maintain the head of bed at the lowest degree of elevation consistent with medical conditions and other restrictions. Limit the amount of time the head of bed is elevated and elevate only when there is a compelling medical indication (e.g., 1–2 hours after tube feeding or with severe respiratory or cardiac compromise). When possible, the patients' knees should be raised before the head of the bed is raised to reduce shearing forces. (Level III) Principle: Elevation of the head of the bed produces shear and friction forces between the skin and the bed surface. Friction and shear may predispose to the development of pressure ulcers. Updated Evidence: Guideline #1.3 (revised): Assess all patients for their risk of developing a pressure ulcer. Use a pressure reducing surface in those patients at risk. Provide a support surface that is properly matched to the individual's need for pressure redistribution, shear reduction, and microclimate control. (Level I—no change) Principle: When compared with a standard hospital mattress, a meta-analysis looking at randomized controlled trials for higher specification foam support surfaces, found that they reduced the incidence of pressure ulcers by 60%. The goal of using a support surface is to reduce the forces of pressure and friction against the patient's body. Descriptive terms for support surfaces have changed from ""static"" or ""dynamic"" options to ""reactive"" or ""active.""

It represents a collaborative effort between the American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Society.The evidence syntheses were discussed and recommendations formulated by a multidisciplinary committee of IPF experts. The evidence was appraised and recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.The guideline panel updated the diagnostic criteria for IPF. Previously defined patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) were refined to patterns of UIP, probable UIP, indeterminate, and alternate diagnosis. For patients with newly detected interstitial lung disease (ILD) who have a high-resolution computed tomography scan pattern of probable UIP, indeterminate, or an alternative diagnosis, conditional recommendations were made for performing BAL and surgical lung biopsy; because of lack of evidence, no recommendation was made for or against performing transbronchial lung biopsy or lung cryobiopsy. In contrast, for patients with newly detected ILD who have a high-resolution computed tomography scan pattern of UIP, strong recommendations were made against performing surgical lung biopsy, transbronchial lung biopsy, and lung cryobiopsy, and a conditional recommendation was made against performing BAL. Additional recommendations included a conditional recommendation for multidisciplinary discussion and a strong recommendation against measurement of serum biomarkers for the sole purpose of distinguishing IPF from other ILDs.The guideline panel provided recommendations related to the diagnosis of IPF.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,2.5

They are a challenge to wound care professionals and consume a great deal of healthcare resources around the globe. This review discusses the pathophysiology of complex chronic wounds and the means and modalities currently available to achieve healing in such patients. Recent Advances: Although often difficult to treat, an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and specific attention toward managing these perturbations can often lead to successful healing. Critical Issues: Overcoming the factors that contribute to delayed healing are key components of a comprehensive approach to wound care and present the primary challenges to the treatment of chronic wounds. When wounds fail to achieve sufficient healing after 4 weeks of standard care, reassessment of underlying pathology and consideration of the need for advanced therapeutic agents should be undertaken. However, selection of an appropriate therapy is often not evidence based. Future Directions: Basic tenets of care need to be routinely followed, and a systematic evaluation of patients and their wounds will also facilitate appropriate care. Underlying pathologies, which result in the failure of these wounds to heal, differ among various types of chronic wounds. A better understanding of the differences between various types of chronic wounds at the molecular and cellular levels should improve our treatment approaches, leading to better healing rates, and facilitate the development of new more effective therapies.

,10.1002/hep.22946,National Institutes of Health consensus development conference statement: Management of hepatitis B,Hepatology,2009.0,"Hepatitis B is a major cause of liver disease worldwide, ranking as a substantial cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The development and use of a vaccine for hepatitis B virus (HBV) has resulted in a substantial decline in the number of new cases of acute hepatitis B among children, adolescents, and adults in the United States. However, this success has not yet been duplicated worldwide, and both acute and chronic HBV infection continue to represent important global health problems. Seven treatments are currently approved for adult patients with chronic HBV infection in the United States: interferon-α, pegylated interferon-α, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Interferon-α and lamivudine have been approved for children with HBV infection. Although available randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) show encouraging short-term results—demonstrating the favorable effect of these agents on such intermediate markers of disease as HBV DNA level, liver enzyme tests, and liver histology—limited rigorous evidence exists demonstrating the effect of these therapies on important long-term clinical outcomes, such as the development of hepatocellular carcinoma or a reduction in deaths. Questions therefore remain about which groups of patients benefit from therapy and at which point in the course of disease this therapy should be initiated. AHRQ, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; anti-HBe, antibody to HBeAg; anti-HBs, antibody to HBsAg; HBeAg, hepatitis B e antigen; HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antigen; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RCT, randomized controlled trials. What is the current burden of hepatitis B? What is the natural history of hepatitis B? What are the benefits and risks of the current therapeutic options for hepatitis B? Which persons with hepatitis B should be treated? What measures are appropriate to monitor therapy and assess outcomes? What are the greatest needs and opportunities for future research on hepatitis B? At the conference, invited experts presented information relevant to these questions and a systematic literature review, prepared under contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), was summarized. The evidence report, available at http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/tp/hepbtp.htm, emphasizes RCTs with health outcomes as their end points. (A concise summary of the evidence report has been published. Conference attendees also provided oral and written comments in response to the conference questions, and we considered all of this evidence when preparing the consensus statement. An estimated 400 million people worldwide are living with chronic HBV infection. Each year, an estimated 500 000 people die of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma caused by chronic infection and an additional 40 000 people die of acute hepatitis B. The prevalence of HBV infection is uneven throughout the world, with significant burdens in Asia and the Pacific Islands, sub-Saharan Africa, the Amazon Basin, and Eastern Europe. The incidence (rate of new cases) of acute HBV infection has decreased dramatically in the United States since the mid-1980s. This reduction can be attributed to the availability of an effective vaccine and widespread immunization of infants and high-risk populations. However, the number of people who have chronic HBV infection remains high because of the long duration of infection and influx of immigrants who have chronic infection. It is estimated that more than 1 million U.S. residents have chronic infection, which contributes to an estimated 2000 to 4000 deaths each year. National surveys indicate that 0.3% to 0.5% of U.S. residents have chronic infection, and 47% to 70% of these persons were born outside the United States. The prevalence of HBV infection is higher among people who were born in countries with a high HBV prevalence and members of subpopulations that have behavioral risk factors for HBV transmission, including injection-drug users and men who have sex with men. More comprehensive screening for HBV is needed for public health evaluation and management of chronically infected persons and their contacts. The public health burden of HBV is almost entirely due to its long-term effects on liver function. Chronic HBV infection is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition to the human suffering that these diseases cause, the social and economic costs are large. More than $1 billion is spent each year for hepatitis B-related hospitalizations. The indirect costs of chronic HBV infection are harder to measure, but include reduced physical and emotional quality of life, reduced economic productivity, long-term disability, and premature death. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted through infected blood or body fluids that enter the body through mucous membranes, wounds, or injection (for example, by sharing needles or syringes). The virus also can be transmitted by sexual contact with an infected person or by perinatal exposure to an infected mother. Acute HBV infection can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptomatic infection is rare in newborns and young children, but symptoms of acute hepatitis B occur more frequently in susceptible adults after infection. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is detectable in the blood within 4 to 10 weeks after infection. The typical incubation period is about 3 months, but it may be as long as 6 months before symptoms develop. In adults, most acute HBV infections are self-limited, and patients recover completely after developing specific antibodies (anti-HBs) and clearing HBsAg from the blood. A small proportion of patients develop severe acute hepatitis B. The risk for severe acute hepatitis B may be increased in persons who are co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis D virus. A small proportion (<5%) of adults develop chronic HBV infection with ongoing viral replication in the liver. Chronic infection occurs in almost all children who are infected with hepatitis B during the perinatal period and in up to 50% of children who become infected between 1 and 5 years of age. Most people who have chronic HBV infection in the United States have been infected since birth or early childhood, and these infections were probably acquired in countries where the prevalence of HBV infection is higher. Chronic HBV infection has 3 major phases: immune tolerant, immune active, and inactive carrier phases (Figure 1).

PET is a quantitative imaging technique and therefore requires a common quality control (QC)/quality assurance (QA) procedure to maintain the accuracy and precision of quantitation. Repeatability and reproducibility are two essential requirements for any quantitative measurement and/or imaging biomarker. Repeatability relates to the uncertainty in obtaining the same result in the same patient when he or she is examined more than once on the same system. However, imaging biomarkers should also have adequate reproducibility, i.e. the ability to yield the same result in the same patient when that patient is examined on different systems and at different imaging sites. Adequate repeatability and reproducibility are essential for the clinical management of patients and the use of FDG PET/CT within multicentre trials. A common standardised imaging procedure will help promote the appropriate use of FDG PET/CT imaging and increase the value of publications and, therefore, their contribution to evidence-based medicine. Moreover, consistency in numerical values between platforms and institutes that acquire the data will potentially enhance the role of semiquantitative and quantitative image interpretation. Precision and accuracy are additionally important as FDG PET/CT is used to evaluate tumour response as well as for diagnosis, prognosis and staging.

Diagnosis of AA is still challenging and some controversies on its management are still present among different settings and practice patterns worldwide. In July 2015, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) organized in Jerusalem the first consensus conference on the diagnosis and treatment of AA in adult patients with the intention of producing evidence-based guidelines. An updated consensus conference took place in Nijemegen in June 2019 and the guidelines have now been updated in order to provide evidence-based statements and recommendations in keeping with varying clinical practice: use of clinical scores and imaging in diagnosing AA, indications and timing for surgery, use of non-operative management and antibiotics, laparoscopy and surgical techniques, intra-operative scoring, and peri-operative antibiotic therapy. Methods This executive manuscript summarizes the WSES guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AA. Literature search has been updated up to 2019 and statements and recommendations have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. The statements were voted, eventually modified, and finally approved by the participants to the consensus conference and by the board of co-authors, using a Delphi methodology for voting whenever there was controversy on a statement or a recommendation. Several tables highlighting the research topics and questions, search syntaxes, and the statements and the WSES evidence-based recommendations are provided. Finally, two different practical clinical algorithms are provided in the form of a flow chart for both adults and pediatric (&lt; 16 years old) patients. Conclusions The 2020 WSES guidelines on AA aim to provide updated evidence-based statements and recommendations on each of the following topics: (1) diagnosis, (2) non-operative management for uncomplicated AA, (3) timing of appendectomy and in-hospital delay, (4) surgical treatment, (5) intra-operative grading of AA, (6) ,management of perforated AA with phlegmon or abscess, and (7) peri-operative antibiotic therapy.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0

Thus, the ASBMR leadership appointed a multidisciplinary task force to address key questions related to case definition, epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic imaging, clinical management, and future areas for research related to the disorder. This report summarizes the findings and recommendations of the task force.The increasing recognition that use of bisphosphonates may be associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) led the leadership of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) to appoint a task force to address a number of key questions related to this disorder.A multidisciplinary expert group reviewed all pertinent published data on bisphosphonate-associated ONJ. Food and Drug Administration drug adverse event reports were also reviewed.A case definition was developed so that subsequent studies could report on the same condition. The task force defined ONJ as the presence of exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that did not heal within 8 wk after identification by a health care provider. Based on review of both published and unpublished data, the risk of ONJ associated with oral bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis seems to be low, estimated between 1 in 10,000 and <1 in 100,000 patient-treatment years. However, the task force recognized that information on incidence of ONJ is rapidly evolving and that the true incidence may be higher. The risk of ONJ in patients with cancer treated with high doses of intravenous bisphosphonates is clearly higher, in the range of 1-10 per 100 patients (depending on duration of therapy). In the future, improved diagnostic imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography or MRI combined with contrast agents and the manipulation of image planes, may identify patients at preclinical or early stages of the disease.

ONJ is associated with oncology-dose parenteral antiresorptive therapy of bisphosphonates (BP) and denosumab (Dmab). The incidence of ONJ is greatest in the oncology patient population (1% to 15%), where high doses of these medications are used at frequent intervals. In the osteoporosis patient population, the incidence of ONJ is estimated at 0.001% to 0.01%, marginally higher than the incidence in the general population (<0.001%). New insights into the pathophysiology of ONJ include antiresorptive effects of BPs and Dmab, effects of BPs on gamma delta T-cells and on monocyte and macrophage function, as well as the role of local bacterial infection, inflammation, and necrosis. Advances in imaging include the use of cone beam computerized tomography assessing cortical and cancellous architecture with lower radiation exposure, magnetic resonance imaging, bone scanning, and positron emission tomography, although plain films often suffice. Other risk factors for ONJ include glucocorticoid use, maxillary or mandibular bone surgery, poor oral hygiene, chronic inflammation, diabetes mellitus, ill-fitting dentures, as well as other drugs, including antiangiogenic agents. Prevention strategies for ONJ include elimination or stabilization of oral disease prior to initiation of antiresorptive agents, as well as maintenance of good oral hygiene. In those patients at high risk for the development of ONJ, including cancer patients receiving high-dose BP or Dmab therapy, consideration should be given to withholding antiresorptive therapy following extensive oral surgery until the surgical site heals with mature mucosal coverage. Management of ONJ is based on the stage of the disease, size of the lesions, and the presence of contributing drug therapy and comorbidity. Conservative therapy includes topical antibiotic oral rinses and systemic antibiotic therapy. Localized surgical debridement is indicated in advanced nonresponsive disease and has been successful. Early data have suggested enhanced osseous wound healing with teriparatide in those without contraindications for its use. Experimental therapy includes bone marrow stem cell intralesional transplantation, low-level laser therapy, local platelet-derived growth factor application, hyperbaric oxygen, and tissue grafting. © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,none,6.5

The degradation of the ECM is of great importance, since it is related to embryonic development and angiogenesis. It is also involved in cell repair and the remodeling of tissues. When the expression of MMPs is altered, it can generate the abnormal degradation of the ECM. This is the initial cause of the development of chronic degenerative diseases and vascular complications generated by diabetes. In addition, this process has an association with neurodegeneration and cancer progression. Within the ECM, the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) inhibit the proteolytic activity of MMPs. TIMPs are important regulators of ECM turnover, tissue remodeling, and cellular behavior. Therefore, TIMPs (similar to MMPs) modulate angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. An interruption in the balance between MMPs and TIMPs has been implicated in the pathophysiology and progression of several diseases. This review focuses on the participation of both MMPs (e.g., MMP-2 and MMP-9) and TIMPs (e.g., TIMP-1 and TIMP-3) in physiological processes and on how their abnormal regulation is associated with human diseases.

There is long‐established evidence that hyperglycaemia in diabetes is associated with adverse periodontal outcomes. However, given the ubiquity of periodontal diseases and the emerging global diabetes epidemic, the complications of which contribute to significant morbidity and premature mortality, it is timely to review the role of periodontitis in diabetes. Aims: To report the epidemiological evidence from cross‐sectional, prospective and intervention studies for the impact of periodontal disease on diabetes incidence, control and complications and to identify potential underpinning mechanisms. Epidemiology: Over the last 20 years, consistent and robust evidence has emerged that severe periodontitis adversely affects glycaemic control in diabetes and glycaemia in non‐diabetes subjects. In diabetes patients, there is a direct and dose‐dependent relationship between periodontitis severity and diabetes complications. Emerging evidence supports an increased risk for diabetes onset in patients with severe periodontitis. Biological mechanisms: Type 2 diabetes is preceded by systemic inflammation, leading to reduced pancreatic b‐cell function, apoptosis and insulin resistance.Increasing evidence supports elevated systemic inflammation (acute‐phase and oxidative stress biomarkers) resulting from the entry of periodontal organisms and their virulence factors into the circulation, providing biological plausibility for the effects of periodontitis on diabetes. AGE (Advanced Glycation Endproducts)–RAGE (Receptor for AGEs) interactions and oxidative‐stress‐mediated pathways provide plausible mechanistic links in the diabetes to periodontitis direction. Interventions: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) consistently demonstrate that mechanical periodontal therapy associates with approximately a 0.4% reduction in HbA1C at 3 months, a clinical impact equivalent to adding a second drug to a pharmacological regime for diabetes. RCTs are needed with larger numbers of subjects and longer term follow‐up, and if results are substantiated, adjunctive periodontal therapies subsequently need to be evaluated. There is no current evidence to support adjunctive use of antimicrobials for periodontal management of diabetes patients.

LATE neuropathological change (LATE-NC) is defined by a stereotypical TDP-43 proteinopathy in older adults, with or without coexisting hippocampal sclerosis pathology. LATE-NC is a common TDP-43 proteinopathy, associated with an amnestic dementia syndrome that mimicked Alzheimer's-type dementia in retrospective autopsy studies. LATE is distinguished from frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology based on its epidemiology (LATE generally affects older subjects), and relatively restricted neuroanatomical distribution of TDP-43 proteinopathy. In community-based autopsy cohorts, ∼25% of brains had sufficient burden of LATE-NC to be associated with discernible cognitive impairment. Many subjects with LATE-NC have comorbid brain pathologies, often including amyloid-β plaques and tauopathy. Given that the 'oldest-old' are at greatest risk for LATE-NC, and subjects of advanced age constitute a rapidly growing demographic group in many countries, LATE has an expanding but under-recognized impact on public health. For these reasons, a working group was convened to develop diagnostic criteria for LATE, aiming both to stimulate research and to promote awareness of this pathway to dementia. We report consensus-based recommendations including guidelines for diagnosis and staging of LATE-NC. For routine autopsy workup of LATE-NC, an anatomically-based preliminary staging scheme is proposed with TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on tissue from three brain areas, reflecting a hierarchical pattern of brain involvement: amygdala, hippocampus, and middle frontal gyrus. LATE-NC appears to affect the medial temporal lobe structures preferentially, but other areas also are impacted. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated that subjects with LATE-NC also had atrophy in the medial temporal lobes, frontal cortex, and other brain regions. Genetic studies have thus far indicated five genes with risk alleles for LATE-NC: GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, KCNMB2, and APOE. The discovery of these genetic risk variants indicate that LATE shares pathogenetic mechanisms with both frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, but also suggests disease-specific underlying mechanisms. Large gaps remain in our understanding of LATE. For advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, there is an urgent need for research focused on LATE, including in vitro and animal models. An obstacle to clinical progress is lack of diagnostic tools, such as biofluid or neuroimaging biomarkers, for ante-mortem detection of LATE. Development of a disease biomarker would augment observational studies seeking to further define the risk factors, natural history, and clinical features of LATE, as well as eventual subject recruitment for targeted therapies in clinical trials.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,none,5.5

A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis‐induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti‐inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal‐directed interventions, early 30‐day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after “recovery” from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long‐term sepsis‐induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis‐associated immune cell defects correlate with long‐term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long‐term patient outcomes.

When deciding the appropriate treatment strategy for active ulcerative colitis one should consider the activity, distribution (proctitis, left-sided, extensive1), and pattern of disease. The disease pattern includes relapse frequency, course of disease, response to previous medications, side-effect profile of medication and extra-intestinal manifestations. The age at onset and disease duration may also be important factors.

#### 5.1.1 Disease activity

The principal disease activity scoring systems used in clinical trials are covered in Section 1.2 and have been comprehensively reviewed.2 However there are some practical points that are relevant for routine clinical use. For example, it is most important to distinguish patients with severe ulcerative colitis necessitating hospital admission from those with mild or moderately active disease who can generally be managed as outpatients. The simplest, best validated and most widely used index for identifying severe UC remains that of Truelove and Witts3: any patient who has a bloody stool frequency ≥ 6/day and a tachycardia (> 90 bpm), or temperature > 37.8 °C, or anaemia (haemoglobin 30 mm/h) has severe ulcerative colitis (Table 1.3). Only one additional criterion in addition to the bloody stool frequency ≥ 6/day is needed to define a severe attack.4,5

It should be standard practice to confirm the presence of active colitis by sigmoidoscopy before starting treatment. Flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy may exclude unexpected causes of symptoms that mimic active disease such as cytomegalovirus colitis, rectal mucosal prolapse, Crohn's disease, malignancy, or even irritable bowel syndrome and haemorrhoidal bleeding. There may be a significant overlap between other diseases that mimic ulcerative colitis and the broad spectrum of UC damage.6,7 In addition, all patients with active disease require stool cultures with Clostridium difficile toxin assay to exclude enteric infection.

We investigated the clinical and prognostic value of fibrocyte counts by comparison with standard clinical parameters and survival. We used healthy age-matched volunteers and patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome as control subjects.Fibrocytes were significantly elevated in patients with stable IPF (n = 51), with a further increase during acute disease exacerbation (n = 7; P < 0.001 vs. control subjects). Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 10) were not different from healthy control subjects or stable patients with IPF. Fibrocyte numbers were not correlated with lung function or radiologic severity scores, but they were an independent predictor of early mortality. The mean survival of patients with fibrocytes higher than 5% of total blood leukocytes was 7.5 months compared with 27 months for patients with less than 5% (P < 0.0001).Fibrocytes are an indicator for disease activity of IPF and might be useful as a clinical marker for disease progression.

It replaces the prior AASLD guideline on the same topic published in 2012 (Table 1).(1) Because this guidance represents an update covering nearly a decade, numerous changes are made. Instead of enumerating the individual changes, the following list represents noticeable revisions: This AASLD Guidance provides a data-supported approach to the management of ascites and HRS. It differs from the AASLD Guidelines, which are supported by systematic reviews of the literature, formal rating of the quality of the evidence, and strength of the recommendations. In contrast, this Guidance was developed by consensus of an expert panel and provides guidance statements based on comprehensive review and analysis of the literature on the topics, with oversight provided by the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee. The AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee chose to perform a Guidance on this topic because a sufficient number of randomized controlled trials were not available to support meaningful systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Hepatic decompensation, defined by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and portal hypertensive gastrointestinal bleeding, is an important landmark in the natural history of cirrhosis.(2) Ascites is commonly the first decompensation-defining event, with 5%-10% of patients with compensated cirrhosis developing ascites per year.(3) The development of ascites is associated with a reduction in 5-year survival from 80% to 30%,(4) which is due in part to patients with ascites being prone to additional complications, such as bacterial infections, electrolyte abnormalities, HRS, and nutritional imbalances, and, consequently, further clinical decline.(5) Patients with cirrhosis who develop clinically significant ascites and related complications should be considered for referral for liver transplantation (LT) evaluation and, when appropriate, palliative care.(6) HRS is a late complication of cirrhosis that accounted for 3.2% of all hospital discharges related to cirrhosis according to a 2012 study based on a large inpatient health care database of patients representative of community hospitals in the United States.(4) Moreover, the number of HRS discharges in the United States has increased significantly in the past 2 decades.(7) HRS was also associated with high inpatient mortality (~46%) as well as longer lengths of stay and higher costs of hospitalizations compared with cirrhosis discharges without HRS. Figure 1 summarizes the key steps in the pathogenesis of ascites and related complications discussed in this document. From the perspective of the management of ascites, pathogenetic events of importance are renal sodium retention, arterial underfilling, and portal hypertension, which may be mitigated by diuretics, albumin infusion, and portal decompressive procedures, respectively.(8, 9) More recently, the advent of vasopressin receptor antagonists provided further insights on the contribution of water retention in the pathogenesis of ascites.(10) Recent reviews provide more detailed discussion of the pathogenesis of ascites.(11-13) HRS is a functional renal failure resulting from hemodynamic changes occurring in patients with ascites and portal hypertension.(14) The primary pathophysiologic mechanism of HRS is reduced renal perfusion secondary to renal vasoconstriction mediated by increased activities of the sympathetic, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, and vasopressin systems,(5) which may be further aggravated by decreased cardiac output in patients with cirrhosis-associated cardiomyopathy. In addition, systemic inflammation that is common among patients with decompensated cirrhosis may trigger immune-mediated renal injury.(15) Finally, emerging evidence suggests that renal autoregulation, a natural defense mechanism to maintain renal blood flow, is impaired in patients with cirrhosis, predisposing them to additional direct hemodynamic renal injury.(16) Together, structural kidney damage can follow severe and/or repeated episodes of such renal events.(17, 18) Although cirrhosis is the most common cause of ascites in the Western world, other potential causes should be considered, including malignancy, heart failure, tuberculosis, and pancreatic disease. The initial evaluation of ascites should include history, physical examination, abdominal doppler ultrasound, laboratory assessment of liver and renal function, serum and urine electrolytes, and a diagnostic paracentesis for analysis of the ascitic fluid (Fig. 2; Tables 2-4).(19, 20) In evaluating the etiology of ascites, the serum albumin ascites gradient is calculated by subtracting the ascitic fluid albumin from the serum albumin in simultaneously obtained samples.(21) A serum albumin ascites gradient ≥1.1 g/dL is highly suggestive of portal hypertension, usually caused by liver disease with an accuracy of approximately 97%, whereas a serum albumin ascites gradient <1.1 g/dL suggests other causes of ascites (Table 4). In contrast, a high ascitic fluid protein (>2.5 g/dL) supports a cardiac source for ascites.(22) Other tests of the ascitic fluid, such as amylase, cytology, or culture for mycobacteria, are not routinely indicated but should be guided by the patient's clinical context. In patients with cirrhosis, ascites can be graded according to the amount of fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavity and classified according to response to treatment (Table 5).(19) No treatment is recommended for grade 1 ascites, as there is no evidence that it improves patient outcomes. Response to therapy and subsequent outcome in patients with grade 2 or 3 ascites depends on several factors such as the underlying cause of cirrhosis; feasibility and effectiveness of therapy to alter the natural course of cirrhosis; presence of superimposed complications such as renal failure, hyponatremia, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP); and adherence of the patient to dietary sodium restriction and diuretics. Moderate dietary sodium restriction (2 g or 90 mmol/day) should be prescribed to achieve a negative sodium balance and net fluid loss. Fluid restriction is not indicated unless hyponatremia is present. Patient education for sodium restriction is essential to maximize adherence while avoiding malnutrition and sarcopenia.(23-25) Instructions about a sodium-restricted diet should include advice on sodium contents of preprepared meals, avoiding adding salt to cooked meals, and guarding against nutritional deficiency.(23) A formal consultation with a dietician should be considered. In most patients with cirrhosis presenting with ascites, dietary sodium restriction alone is insufficient and diuretic therapy is necessary. The patient should be made aware that daily monitoring of body weight, preferably at the same time of the day, is essential in assessing the efficacy of diuretics and preventing their adverse",OpenAlex,0,1,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,hemorrhage,none,11.5

The expression and activity of MMPs in non‐inflamed periodontium is low but is drastically enhanced to pathologically elevated levels due to the dental plaque and infection‐induced periodontal inflammation. Soft and hard tissue destruction during periodontitis and peri‐implantitis are thought to reflect a cascade of events involving bacterial virulence factors/enzymes, pro‐inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and MMPs. However, recent studies suggest that MMPs can also exert anti‐inflammatory effects in defence of the host by processing anti‐inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as by regulating apoptotic and immune responses. MMP‐inhibitor (MMPI)‐drugs, such as doxycycline, can be used as adjunctive medication to augment both the scaling and root planing‐treatment of periodontitis locally and to reduce inflammation systematically. Furthermore, MMPs present in oral fluids (gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), peri‐implant sulcular fluid (PISF), mouth‐rinses and saliva) can be utilized to develop new non‐invasive, chair/bed‐side, point‐of‐care diagnostics for periodontitis and dental peri‐implantitis.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,1.5

,10.1111/iej.13128,Management of deep caries and the exposed pulp,International Endodontic Journal,2019.0,"Caries prevalence remains high throughout the world, with the burden of disease increasingly affecting older and socially disadvantaged groups in Western cultures. If left untreated, caries will advance through dentine stimulating pulpitis and eventually pulp infection and necrosis; however, if conservatively managed, pulpal recovery occurs even in deep carious lesions. Traditionally, deep caries management was destructive with nonselective (complete) removal of all carious dentine; however, the promotion of minimally invasive biologically based treatment strategies has been advocated for selective (partial) caries removal and a reduced risk of pulp exposure. Selective caries removal strategies can be one-visit as indirect pulp treatment or two-visit using a stepwise approach. Management strategies for the treatment of the cariously exposed pulp are also shifting with avoidance of pulpectomy and the re-emergence of vital pulp treatment (VPT) techniques such as partial and complete pulpotomy. These changes stem from an improved understanding of the pulp–dentine complex's defensive and reparative response to irritation, with harnessing the release of bioactive dentine matrix components and careful handling of the damaged tissue considered critical. Notably, the development of new pulp capping materials such as mineral trioxide aggregate, which although not an ideal material, has resulted in more predictable treatments from both a histological and a clinical perspective. Unfortunately, the changes in management are only supported by relatively weak evidence with case series, cohort studies and preliminary studies containing low patient numbers forming the bulk of the evidence. As a result, critical questions related to the superiority of one caries removal technique over another, the best pulp capping biomaterial or whether pulp exposure is a negative prognostic factor remain unanswered. There is an urgent need to promote minimally invasive treatment strategies in Operative Dentistry and Endodontology; however, the development of accurate diagnostic tools, evidence-based management strategies and education in management of the exposed pulp are critical in the future.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,infection,none,2.5

There is currently no agreed terminology or gold-standard diagnostic criteria for the spectrum of lower respiratory tract infections complicating stroke, which has implications for clinical practice and research. The aim of this consensus was to propose standardized terminology and operational diagnostic criteria for lower respiratory tract infections complicating acute stroke. Methods— Systematic literature searches of multiple electronic databases were undertaken. An evidence review and 2 rounds of consensus consultation were completed before a final consensus meeting in September 2014, held in Manchester, United Kingdom. Consensus was defined a priori as ≥75% agreement between the consensus group members. Results— Consensus was reached for the following: (1) stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is the recommended terminology for the spectrum of lower respiratory tract infections within the first 7 days after stroke onset; (2) modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria are proposed for SAP as follows—probable SAP: CDC criteria met, but typical chest x-ray changes absent even after repeat or serial chest x-ray; definite SAP: CDC criteria met, including typical chest x-ray changes; (3) there is limited evidence for a diagnostic role of white blood cell count or C-reactive protein in SAP; and (4) there is insufficient evidence for the use of other biomarkers (eg, procalcitonin).

Therefore, although the entity is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain, diligence is always required because if untreated, mortality has consistently been reported in the range of 50%. Early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are the cornerstones of modern treatment and are essential to reduce the high mortality associated with this entity.

Cell-associated and soluble pattern-recognition receptors, e.g. Toll-like receptors, inflammasome receptors, and complement components initiate complex cellular cascades by recognizing or sensing different pathogen and damage-associated molecular patterns, respectively. Cytokines and chemokines represent alarm messages for leukocytes and once activated, these cells travel long distances to targeted inflamed tissues. Although it is a crucial survival mechanism, prolonged inflammation is detrimental and participates in numerous chronic age-related diseases. This article will review the onset of inflammation and link its functions to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of severe vision loss in aged individuals in the developed countries. In this progressive disease, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) results in the death of photoreceptors, leading to a loss of central vision. The RPE is prone to oxidative stress, a factor that together with deteriorating functionality, e.g. decreased intracellular recycling and degradation due to attenuated heterophagy/autophagy, induces inflammation. In the early phases, accumulation of intracellular lipofuscin in the RPE and extracellular drusen between RPE cells and Bruch's membrane can be clinically detected. Subsequently, in dry (atrophic) AMD there is geographic atrophy with discrete areas of RPE loss whereas in the wet (exudative) form there is neovascularization penetrating from the choroid to retinal layers.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is due to an autoimmune destruction of the insulin‐producing pancreatic beta cells, and type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance coupled by a failure of the beta cell to compensate. Animal models for type 1 diabetes range from animals with spontaneously developing autoimmune diabetes to chemical ablation of the pancreatic beta cells. Type 2 diabetes is modelled in both obese and non‐obese animal models with varying degrees of insulin resistance and beta cell failure. This review outlines some of the models currently used in diabetes research. In addition, the use of transgenic and knock‐out mouse models is discussed. Ideally, more than one animal model should be used to represent the diversity seen in human diabetic patients.

A rate of IC <5% in patients with CS <3 was the primary end point. Design: Prospective, cohort, observational study. Setting: Thirty-six medical-surgical intensive care units of Spain, Argentina, and France. Patients: A total of 1,107 non-neutropenic adult intensive care unit patients admitted for at least 7 days between April 2006 and June 2007. Measurements and Main Results: Clinical data, surveillance cultures for fungal growth, and serum levels of (1–3)-beta-d-glucan and anti-Candida antibodies (in a subset of patients) were recorded. The CS was calculated as follows (variables coded as absent = 0, present = 1): total parenteral nutrition ×1, plus surgery ×1, plus multifocal Candida colonization ×1, plus severe sepsis ×2. A CS ≥3 accurately selected patients at high risk for IC. The colonization index was registered if ≥0.5. The rate of IC was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–3.54) among patients with CS <3, with a linear association between increasing values of CS and IC rate (p ≤ 0.001).

Background: Anastomotic leak is still the most dreaded complication in colorectal surgery. Many risk factors have been identified to date, but multicentric prospective studies on anastomotic leak after colon resection are lacking. Methods: Fifty-two hospitals participated in this prospective, observational study. Data of 3193 patients, operated for colon cancer with primary anastomosis without stoma, were included in a prospective online database (September 2011–September 2012). Forty-two pre-/intraoperative variables, related to patient, tumor, surgical procedure, and hospital, were analyzed as potential independent risk factors for anastomotic leak (60-day follow-up). A nomogram was created to easily predict the risk of anastomotic leak for a given patient. Results: The anastomotic leak rate was 8.7%, and widely varied between hospitals (variance of 0.24 on the logit scale). Anastomotic leak significantly increased mortality (15.2% vs 1.9% in patients without anastomotic leak, P < 0.0001) and length of hospitalization (median 23 vs 7 days in uncomplicated patients, P < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, the following variables were independent risk factors for anastomotic leak: obesity [P = 0.003, odds ratio (OR) = 2.7], preoperative serum total proteins (P = 0.03, OR = 0.7 per g/dL), male sex (P = 0.03, OR = 1.6), ongoing anticoagulant treatment (P = 0.05, OR = 1.8), intraoperative complication (P = 0.03, OR = 2.2), and number of hospital beds (P = 0.04, OR = 0.95 per 100 beds). Conclusions: Anastomotic leak after colon resection for cancer is a frequent, relevant complication.

Combinations of markers, as opposed to single ones, may improve diagnosis and thereby survival. We therefore compared the diagnostic characteristics of novel and routinely used biomarkers of sepsis alone and in combination. Methods This prospective cohort study included patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome who were suspected of having community-acquired infections. It was conducted in a medical emergency department and department of infectious diseases at a university hospital. A multiplex immunoassay measuring soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM)-1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was used in parallel with standard measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and neutrophils. Two composite markers were constructed – one including a linear combination of the three best performing markers and another including all six – and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare their performance and those of the individual markers. Results A total of 151 patients were eligible for analysis. Of these, 96 had bacterial infections. The AUCs for detection of a bacterial cause of inflammation were 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.60) for suPAR, 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) for sTREM-1, 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.72) for MIF, 0.72 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.79) for PCT, 0.74 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.81) for neutrophil count, 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.86) for CRP, 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.91) for the composite three-marker test, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) for the composite six-marker test. The AUC of the six-marker test was significantly greater than that of the single markers. Conclusion Combining information from several markers improves diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial versus nonbacterial causes of inflammation. Measurements of suPAR, sTREM-1 and MIF had limited value as single markers, whereas PCT and CRP exhibited acceptable diagnostic characteristics.

In a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial, 101 patients with VAP were assigned to an antibiotic discontinuation strategy according to guidelines (control group) or to serum procalcitonin concentrations (procalcitonin group) with an antibiotic regimen selected by the treating physician. The primary end-point was antibiotic-free days alive assessed 28 days after VAP onset and analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Procalcitonin determination significantly increased the number of antibiotic free-days alive 28 days after VAP onset (13 (2–21) days versus 9.5 (1.5–17) days). This translated into a reduction in the overall duration of antibiotic therapy of 27% in the procalcitonin group (p = 0.038). After adjustment for age, microbiology and centre effect, the rate of antibiotic discontinuation on day 28 remained higher in the procalcitonin group compared with patients treated according to guidelines (hazard rate 1.6, 95% CI 1.02–2.71).

It is a largely preventable cancer, since most of the different risk factors identified, such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and betel nut chewing, are behaviors that increase the likelihood of the disease. Given its high mortality, early diagnosis is of utmost importance. Prevention and the anticipation of diagnosis begin with identification of potentially malignant lesions of the oral mucosa and with local conditions promoting chronic inflammation. Therefore, every lesion must be recognized promptly and treated adequately. The clinical recognition and evaluation of oral mucosal lesions can detect up to 99% of oral cancers/premalignancies. As stated by the World Health Organization, any suspicious lesion that does not subside within two weeks from detection and removal of local causes of irritation must be biopsied. Surgical biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of oral cancer.

Stem cell-based therapy, including human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has recently emerged as a key player in regenerative medicine. hPSCs are defined as self-renewable cell types conferring the ability to differentiate into various cellular phenotypes of the human body, including three germ layers. MSCs are multipotent progenitor cells possessing self-renewal ability (limited in vitro) and differentiation potential into mesenchymal lineages, according to the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT). This review provides an update on recent clinical applications using either hPSCs or MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), or the umbilical cord (UC) for the treatment of human diseases, including neurological disorders, pulmonary dysfunctions, metabolic/endocrine-related diseases, reproductive disorders, skin burns, and cardiovascular conditions. Moreover, we discuss our own clinical trial experiences on targeted therapies using MSCs in a clinical setting, and we propose and discuss the MSC tissue origin concept and how MSC origin may contribute to the role of MSCs in downstream applications, with the ultimate objective of facilitating translational research in regenerative medicine into clinical applications. The mechanisms discussed here support the proposed hypothesis that BM-MSCs are potentially good candidates for brain and spinal cord injury treatment, AT-MSCs are potentially good candidates for reproductive disorder treatment and skin regeneration, and UC-MSCs are potentially good candidates for pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome treatment.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,5.0

This, in part, has been driven by reliance on in vitro data or animal models, which may not directly correlate to clinical evidence on the importance of biofilms. Limited data presented in human studies have further contributed to the uncertainty. Guidelines for care of chronic wounds with a focus on biofilms are needed to help aid the identification and management of biofilms, providing a clinical focus to support clinicians in improving patient care through evidence-based medicine. Methods: A Global Wound Biofilm Expert Panel, comprising 10 clinicians and researchers with expertise in laboratory and clinical aspects of biofilms, was identified and convened. A modified Delphi process, based on published scientific data and expert opinion, was used to develop consensus statements that could help identify and treat biofilms as part of the management of chronic nonhealing wounds. Using an electronic survey, panel members rated their agreement with statements about biofilm identification and treatment, and the management of chronic nonhealing wounds. Final consensus statements were agreed on in a face-to-face meeting. Results: Participants reached consensus on 61 statements in the following topic areas: understanding biofilms and the problems they cause clinicians; current diagnostic options; clinical indicators of biofilms; future options for diagnostic tests; treatment strategies; mechanical debridement; topical antiseptics; screening antibiofilm agents; and levels of evidence when choosing antibiofilm treatments. Conclusion: This consensus document attempts to clarify misunderstandings about the role of biofilms in clinical practice, and provides a basis for clinicians to recognize biofilms in chronic nonhealing wounds and manage patients optimally.

Indeed, the defective mucociliary clearance which characterizes the disease is associated with local immunological disorders. In addition, the prolonged therapy with antibiotics and the use of corticosteroid treatments also facilitate fungal growth. An important fungal biota has been described in respiratory secretions of patients suffering from CF. Aspergillus fumigatus, Scedosporium apiospermum and Aspergillus terreus for filamentous fungi and Candida albicans for yeasts are the main fungal species associated with CF. Although less common, several fungal species including Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus nidulans may be isolated transiently from CF respiratory secretions, while others such as Exophiala dermatitidis and Scedosporium prolificans may chronically colonize the airways. Moreover, some of them like Penicillium emersonii and Acrophialophora fusispora are encountered in humans almost exclusively in the context of CF. As fungal complications in CF patients are essentially caused by filamentous fungi the present review will not include works related to yeasts. In CF patients, fungi may sometimes be responsible for deterioration of lung function, as occurs in allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) which is the most common fungal disease in this context.

Immune system activation alters sleep, and sleep in turn affects the innate and adaptive arm of our body’s defense system. Stimulation of the immune system by microbial challenges triggers an inflammatory response, which, depending on its magnitude and time course, can induce an increase in sleep duration and intensity, but also a disruption of sleep. Enhancement of sleep during an infection is assumed to feedback to the immune system to promote host defense. Indeed, sleep affects various immune parameters, is associated with a reduced infection risk, and can improve infection outcome and vaccination responses. The induction of a hormonal constellation that supports immune functions is one likely mechanism underlying the immune-supporting effects of sleep. In the absence of an infectious challenge, sleep appears to promote inflammatory homeostasis through effects on several inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines. This notion is supported by findings that prolonged sleep deficiency (e.g., short sleep duration, sleep disturbance) can lead to chronic, systemic low-grade inflammation and is associated with various diseases that have an inflammatory component, like diabetes, atherosclerosis, and neurodegeneration.

This article represents a call to action from the interdisciplinary Alliance to Advance Patient Nutrition to highlight the critical role of nutrition intervention in clinical care and suggest practical ways for prompt diagosis and treatment of malnourished patients and those at risk for malnutrition.

Zinc supplementation also decreased oxidative stress biomarkers and decreased inflammatory cytokines in the elderly. In our studies in the experimental model of zinc deficiency in humans, we showed that zinc deficiency per se increased the generation of IL-1β and its mRNA in human mononuclear cells following LPS stimulation. Zinc supplementation upregulated A20, a zinc transcription factor, which inhibited the activation of NF-κB, resulting in decreased generation of inflammatory cytokines.

Methods Ninety adult trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit of our tertiary care hospital were evaluated in a prospective case study. During the initial 24 hours after trauma the Injury Severity Score, the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were evaluated. PCT, CRP, the sepsis criteria (American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine definitions), and the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score were measured at days 1–7, as well as at days 14 and 21, concluding the observation period with the 28-day survival. Results The induction of PCT and CRP varied in patients suffering from trauma. PCT increased only moderately in most patients and peaked at day 1–2 after trauma, the concentrations rapidly declining thereafter. CRP ubiquitously increased and its kinetics were much slower. Complications such as sepsis, infection, blood transfusion, prolonged intensive care unit treatment, and poor outcome were more frequent in patients with initially high PCT (&gt;1 ng/ml), whereas increases of CRP showed no positive correlation. Conclusion In patients with multiple trauma due to an accident, the PCT level provides more information than the CRP level since only moderate amounts of PCT are induced, and higher concentrations correlate with more severe trauma and a higher frequency of various complications, including sepsis and infection. Most importantly, the moderate trauma-related increase of PCT and the rapidly declining concentrations provide a baseline value near to the normal range at an earlier time frame than for CRP, thus allowing a faster and more valid prediction of sepsis during the early period after trauma.",OpenAlex,0,0,2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,3.0

The management of severe infections caused by P. acnes involves a combination of antimicrobial and surgical treatment (often removal of the device). Intravenous penicillin G and ceftriaxone are the first choice for serious infections, with vancomycin and daptomycin as alternatives, and amoxicillin, rifampicin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and levofloxacin for oral treatment. Sonication of explanted prosthetic material improves the diagnosis of implant-associated infections. Molecular methods may further increase the sensitivity of P. acnes detection.

Different pathogenetic mechanisms might cause similar asthma symptoms and might be operant in a certain phenotype. These putative mechanisms are addressed by the term 'endotype'. Classification of asthma based on endotypes provides advantages for epidemiological, genetic, and drug-related studies. A successful definition of endotypes should link key pathogenic mechanisms with the asthma phenotype. Thus, the identification of corresponding molecular biomarkers for individual pathogenic mechanism underlying phenotypes or subgroups within a phenotype is important.

While SSIs are widely recognized as preventable, the burden of these infections remains high, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where healthcare resources are limited, and surgical care may not consistently meet recommended standards. In Ethiopia, as in many similar settings, the lack of robust, context-specific predictive tools limits the ability of healthcare providers to proactively manage SSI risks. Current predictive models and nomograms for SSI risk are generally developed in high-resource settings and may not accurately capture the unique risk factors in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was Development and validation of nomogram for Surgical Site Infection Prediction Among General Surgery Patients in Amhara. A prospective follow-up study was conducted involving general surgery patients at referral hospitals in the Amhara region. Predictors of SSIs were identified through logistic regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed based on these predictors. The model was internally validated using bootstrapping techniques to assess the accuracy and reliability of the risk estimates. Model performance was evaluated in terms of discrimination, measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and calibration, using calibration plots. The incidence of SSI was 39.6%. The key prognostic predictors of this model were: sex, age, diabetes mellitus (DM), wound classification, wound care, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, residence, surgery duration, preoperative hospital stays, alcohol consumption, and prior surgical history. The model's discrimination power was 90.1% with 95% CI (87-93%) and its calibration is well fitted with 45 degrees. The bootstrapped model produced consistent β coefficients, supporting the stability and robustness of the model. The nomogram was developed with key predictors of SSI and demonstrated excellent discrimination ability, with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.91). Calibration plots showed a strong agreement between predicted and observed probabilities, indicating the model is well-calibrated. The incidence of SSI was notably high. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, sex, age, diabetes mellitus (DM), wound classification, wound care practices, patient residence, surgery duration, preoperative hospital stay, alcohol use, and history of previous surgeries were key prognostic predictors. The validated model had an excellent discrimination power with well fitted calibration. The developed nomogram accurately predicts the risk of SSIs among general surgery patients.

The National Trauma Databank (NTDB) was used to identify adult patients (ages 18-64 years) with penetrating colonic injuries for the years 2013-2015. We included patients with Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 9-24 excluding patients with concomitant extra-abdominal Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3 or more. Subjects arriving without signs of life, expiring in ER or with missing data were excluded. Data was collected for age, gender, vital signs on presentation, discharge disposition and length of stay (LOS). Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not fecal diversion was performed within 1 day of presentation. Primary outcome assessed was in-hospital mortality and unplanned return to OR. Secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, organ surgical site infection (SSI), deep SSI, severe sepsis and unplanned intubation. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS for windows. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Of 2,598,467 patients, 5344 (0.21%) sustained a penetrating colonic injury. 2339 (43.8%) patients met criteria for age, ISS, AIS, signs of life and ED outcome. 173 patients underwent fecal diversion within 24 h of presentation (Group 1) while 708 did not (Group 2).

Data from 647 patients with SSI who underwent LDH surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Medical University (AFMU) from 2020 to 2023 were collected. Ultimately, 241 patients with SSI were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation sets with a ratio of 7:3. LASSO regression, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression were utilized to identify target variables and establish the prediction model, which was subsequently validated. Six factors-Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Postoperative Suction Drainage (PSD), Gelatin Sponge (GS), None-Preoperative Antibiotic (NPTA), and Thrombin Time (TT)-were selected to construct the nomogram model.

The primary objective was the rate of SSIs based on CDC criteria. Multivariate analysis took place to identify risk factors for SSIs. A total of 326 patients (61.4%) received an AP within 30 min, 166 (31.3%) between 30 and 60 min, 22 (4.1%) more than 1 h before surgery, and 15 (2.8%) after surgery. In 19 cases (3.6%) a SSI occurred during hospital stay. A multivariate analysis did not identify AP timing as a risk factor for the occurrence of SSIs. With significance, more surgical site occurrences (SSO) were diagnosed when cefuroxime/metronidazole was given. Our results suggest that AP with cefuroxime/metronidazole is less effective in reducing SSO compared with mezlocillin/sulbactam and tazobactam/piperacillin. We assume that the timing of this AP regimen of < 30 min or 30-60 min prior to colorectal surgery does not impact the SSI rate.",PubMed,0,0,3,2,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,antimicrobial,8.5

Even though not generally recommended for similar procedures, general administration of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) is still widely used in wrist arthroscopy. A clinical ambispective dual-centre study was performed to determine whether PAP reduces postoperative infection rates after soft tissue-only wrist arthroscopies. Retrospective and prospective data was collected at two hospitals with departments specialized in hand surgery. During the study period, 464 wrist arthroscopies were performed, of these 178 soft-tissue-only interventions met the study criteria and were included. Signs of postoperative infection and possible adverse drug effects (ADEs) of PAP were monitored. Additionally, risk factors for surgical site infection (SSIs), such as diabetes mellitus and BMI, were obtained. The overall infection rate of SSI was zero. Neither in the PAP group (n = 69) nor in the control group (n = 109) were signs of postoperative infection observed. Observed symptoms of ADEs were three-times higher in the PAP group when compared to the control-group (16.3 vs 5.5%; p = 0.043). No major ADEs were observed, but one in ten patients in the PAP group reported mild to severe intestinal or hypersensitivity symptoms. We demonstrate that the number needed to treat (NNT) with PAP to prevent one postoperative infection in soft-tissue arthroscopies of the wrist is > 109.

Novel vessel sealing techniques are increasingly utilized ubiquitously. We sought to systematically summarize all relevant data and to define the current evidence on the safety and utility of energy devices for clipless−sutureless laparoscopic appendectomy in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Materials and Methods: This review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria included studies with laparoscopic appendectomy for appendicitis. The intervention included patients undergoing division of mesoappendix and/or securing of the appendicular base using diathermy (Monopolar or Bipolar or LigaSure Sealing Device) or Harmonic Scalpel (Group A) compared to patients undergoing division of mesoappendix and/or securing of the appendicular base using endoclip or Hem-o-lok or ligature (Group B). The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black scale. The outcomes of surgical site infection (SSI) or intra-abdominal collection, postoperative ileus, average operative duration, and length of hospital stay (LHS) were compared. Results: Six comparative studies were included; three were retrospective, two were prospective, and one was ambispective. Meta-analysis revealed a shorter operative duration in Group A with respect to appendicular base ligation (MD −12.34, 95% CI −16.57 to −8.11, p < 0.00001) and mesoappendix division (MD −8.06, 95% CI −14.03 to −2.09, p = 0.008). The pooled risk ratios showed no difference in SSI between groups. Additionally, no difference was observed in LHS. The risk of postoperative ileus was higher in group B regarding mesoappendix division (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.93, p = 0.02), but no difference was found concerning appendicular base ligation. The included studies showed a moderate-to-high risk of bias. Conclusions: Clipless−sutureless laparoscopic appendectomy is safe and fast. Postoperative ileus seems less common with energy devices for mesoappendix division. However, the studies included have a moderate-to-high risk of bias.

The objectives of this study were to compare the incidence of SSI in patients with type 2 diabetes, investigate the correlation between perioperative glycemic variability and postoperative SSI, and develop a nomogram model to predict the risk of SSI. This study retrospectively analysed 339 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent TLIF in the spinal surgery department of the Affiliated Zhongda Hospital of Southeast University from January 2018 to September 2021. The medical records of all patients were collected, and postoperative infection cases were determined according to the diagnostic criteria of surgical site infection. The risk factors for postoperative SSI were analysed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. And Nomogram prediction model was established and validated. The nomogram incorporated seven independent predictors. Preoperative FPG-CV was the most important independent risk predictor of SSI, followed by preoperative MFBG, duration of drain placement, postoperative FPG-CV, preoperative blood glucose control scheme, duration of diabetes >5 years, and the number of fused vertebrae ≥2. The nomogram showed good diagnostic accuracy for the SS of both the training cohort and the validation cohort (AUC = 0.915 and AUC = 0.890). The calibration curves for the two cohorts both showed optimal agreement between nomogram prediction and actual observation.

36055663,,[Complications in Spine Surgery: Prospective 13-year follow-up of unplanned revision spinal surgeries].,Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca,2022.0,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Unplanned revision spinal surgeries constitute a complication in the treatment algorithm for the patient, surgeon and the entire treatment team. Any complication leading to an unplanned revision surgery is therefore undesirable. The percentage of complications referred to in publications on this topic focusing on unplanned revision surgeries only varies from 0.7% to 29.8%, with obvious diversity of causes and significant risk factors. The purpose of the submitted paper is to carry out a prospective evaluation of the most serious complications requiring unplanned revision spinal surgeries in the course of 13 years at a single department performing a broad range of spinal surgeries, namely 1300 procedures annually on average. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period 2006 - 2018, a total of 16872 patients underwent a surgery at our department. During this period, in 556 patients an unplanned revision spinal surgery was performed. In agreement with literature, the patients were categorised by cause for revision: 1/ impaired wound suprafascial (superficial) healing - superficial infection, 2/ impaired wound subfascial (deep) healing - deep infection, 3/ surgical wound hematoma, 4/ deterioration or occurrence of new neurological symptoms, 5/ cerebrospinal fluid leak (liquorrhoea) and 6/ others. The patients operated on for inflammatory diseases of the spine with subsequent infectious complications, primarily treated at another department, and the patients with open spinal injury were excluded from the study. According to these criteria, a cohort of 521 patients was followed up, namely 236 (45.3%) women and 285 (54.7%) men, aged 1 year to 86 years, with the mean age of 55.0 years (median 60 years). Demographic effects, tobacco smoking and comorbidities were followed up in the cohort, together with the effects of surgery, diagnosis, surgical approach and physician. All parameters were statistically evaluated at a p-value below 0.05, including comparison with the control group. RESULTS Of the total number of 16872 operated patients, a group of 521 (3.09%) patients undergoing a revision surgery for complications was analysed in detail. Impaired wound healing - infection (SSI) was found in 199 (1.18%) patients, of whom superficial infection in 124 cases (0.73%) and deep infection in 75 cases (0.44%). Hematoma in a surgical site was detected in 149 (0.88%) patients. In 63 (0.37%) cases, deterioration of the existing neurological finding or occurrence of a new neurological finding were observed, in 68 (0.40%) cases cerebrospinal fluid leak was reported and in 40 (0.24%) cases other complications were identified. As concerns the surgical assistant, the percentage of complications in a board-certified physician is 2.77 (1.14 - 3.29%), in a medical resident it increases to 3.60 (0.00 - 9.38%) (p<0.05). The prevalence of smokers in the group with complications (N=521) was 34.7%. The control group (N=3650) included 30.1% of smokers (p<0.05). The mean age of patients in the group with complications (N=521) was higher, i.e. 55.0 years, with the median age of 60.0 years, than in the primary cohort (N=16872) with the mean age of 49.8 years and the median age of 52.0 years (p<0.05). The mean BMI in the group with complications was (N=521) 27.3, the median BMI was 26.9. In the control group (N=16872), the mean BMI was 27.11, the median BMI was 26.8. In this case the significance (p>0.05) was not confirmed. The complications prevailed strongly in posterior surgical approach, namely in 483 patients (92.7%). As concerns the surgically treated segment, lumber spine dominates with 320 (61.4%) cases. Corticosteroid therapy was used twice as often in women, namely in 13.1% vs. 6.3%. The group of patients with complications (N=521) showed a much higher average length of hospital stay of 12.8 days compared to the average of 4.6 days (N=16872). DISCUSSION In our cohort, the complication rate was 3.09%, of which infections constituted 1.18%, which is in agreement with similarly focused papers. As regards the patient-related factors, in our study the results reported by literature were confirmed with respect to the age, smoking and comorbidities. Moreover, the posterior surgical procedure, lumber spine surgery and presence of a medical resident are essential (p<0.05). No major age difference was observed between women and men (p>0.05). Obesity is one of the key risk factors, especially in infectious complications. In our cohort, a higher BMI did not increase the risk of complications in general (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS In correlation with current literature, our cohort confirmed a significantly higher risk of complications leading to revision spinal surgery associated with age, smoking, posterior surgical procedure in thoracic or lumber spine, and presence of a medical resident as a surgical assistant. The average length of hospital stay was demonstrably longer in complicated patients, it almost tripled compared to the whole cohort.

,10.1097/00000542-200406000-00034,Prevention and Management of Intrathecal Drug Delivery and Spinal Cord Stimulation System Infections,Anesthesiology,2004.0,"FULLY implantable devices or drug–device combinations, such as intrathecal drug delivery (DD) systems and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) systems, increasingly are used for the treatment of chronic intractable pain. 1,2Another approved indication for intrathecal DD systems is the administration of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) to treat medically intractable spasticity of spinal or cerebral origin. 3–5Although patients with cancer, spinal cord injuries, or cerebral palsy have a reduced life expectancy, the majority of intrathecal drug administration devices—and nearly all SCS devices—are implanted in patients with painful non–cancer-related disorders that are associated with a normal life span. Therefore, long-term implantable devices used for the treatment of pain and spasticity should have a relatively benign safety record. 6,7Device-related infection is the most common, potentially reducible, serious adverse event associated with intrathecal DD or SCS devices.Reducing the number of implantable DD and SCS device infections is important for various reasons. One is that treatment of an established infection often involves temporary or permanent removal of the device, which causes cessation of drug or stimulation therapy. Therapy cessation (with or without eventual device replacement) increases the risks, discomfort, inconvenience, and expenses of patients who experience infectious complications. Abrupt cessation of intrathecal drug therapy may precipitate drug withdrawal symptoms and, in the case of ITB, can have fatal consequences. 8In rare cases, device-associated infections can progress to fatal sepsis, meningitis, or both.Available data indicate that implantable DD and SCS device infections share important features with other surgical site infections (SSIs), including those that affect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts and electrophysiologic cardiac devices such as implantable pacemakers and cardioverter–defibrillators (ICDs). Management of infections associated with DD and SCS systems typically involves administration of antibiotics and explantation of the devices. Measures that reduce the incidence of other SSIs also should reduce the infection rate associated with the implantation of SCS and intrathecal DD devices.The authors reviewed data pertaining to infections associated with DD and SCS. Sources of data included published 1and unpublished clinical study data, postmarket and medical device reporting (MDR) data, published meta-analyses, US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and other selected publications about prevention of SSIs, 9,10and pertinent studies from the CSF shunt infection literature 11–42and from the ICD infection literature. 43–51Clinical study data included information about implanted DD and neurostimulation systems marketed by Medtronic, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Information regarding device-related infections was available from three monitored multicenter device studies (model 8709 catheter, SynchroMed®10-ml pump, and IsoMed®pump) and one monitored multicenter study of an investigational intrathecal drug. The 8709 catheter study results were published previously. 1Results of the two pump studies and one intrathecal drug study are unpublished to date.The postmarket and MDR data included information about implanted DD and neurostimulation systems reported to the device manufacturer (Medtronic, Inc.), information which is reported also to the US Food and Drug Administration. The DD and SCS infection data analyzed in this review were reported between September 1, 2000, and July 1, 2002. Because of confidentiality regulations and voluntary reporting practices, it was not possible to audit postmarket surveillance data by comparing the information voluntarily reported by health-care professionals, patients, or both to original medical records. Such limitations undoubtedly caused cases of DD or SCS device–related infections to go unreported.Reasons for considering DD and SCS devices together and for including a focused review of the recent CSF shunt and ICD infection literature include the following: Allowing for the differences in patient populations, underlying disease states, and other factors—CSF shunts and DD devices both involve catheterization of the subarachnoid space with a fluid-conduit system and, like SCS, involve tunneling a portion of the implanted system subcutaneously between two anatomical sites. Neurosurgeons implant and manage virtually all patients with CSF shunts and implant a substantial proportion of DD and SCS devices. In general, neurosurgeons use similar methods to minimize the occurrence of infections associated with each type of implant surgery. ICD and SCS devices are similar to each other in size and appearance but are smaller than DD pumps. ICD implantation also involves tunneling from one anatomical site to another. Infection is a frequent, serious, and potentially reducible complication associated with implantation of all of these devices (DD, SCS, CSF shunts, and ICD). Reported infection rates for the various devices are comparable. 1,2,4–6,11–51Despite the differences between DD and SCS devices and therapy, a review of the postmarket infection surveillance data presented in this article revealed similarities in most of the factors that were examined.The risks, prevention, and management of infections associated with implantable DD and SCS systems have not been explored in detail. In contrast, the CSF shunt and ICD infection literature is substantial. The CSF shunt infection literature contains reliable, high-level evidence regarding patient-related risk factors and methods to minimize the incidence of infection. Given the similarities among the various kinds of device-related infections, information from the medical literature and data from clinical trials and postmarket surveillance can be used to formulate general guidelines and recommendations for the prevention and management of DD and SCS infections.The diagnosis of an implantable device–related SSI is established definitively by identification or culture of microorganisms (most commonly bacteria) or both on specimens from a clinically suspect surgical wound or implant site. Clinical signs of wound infection can include fever, redness, swelling, pain, wound exudate, poor healing, or skin erosion at the implant site. Meningismus indicates CSF involvement. Most cases reported in the postmarket and clinical studies reviewed in this article met those strict criteria. However, the need to begin treatment of suspected infections that involved device components implanted within the spinal canal sometimes prompted physicians to begin antibiotic therapy, to remove devices without waiting for the results of cultures or stains, or both. It is possible that some device infections reported by clinicians and investigators were misdiagnosed (false–positives).The device-related infections that occurred in four DD device or drug–device clinical studies are summarized in table 1. The aggregate total period at risk for the occurrence and detection of an infection in those studies was 7,620.8 device-months.

A wide range of SSI rates have been proposed in the literature depending on clinical setting and procedure type.All spinal surgeries performed at a university-affiliated tertiary-care center from July 2005 to December 2010 were identified using diagnosis-related group, current procedural terminology, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes and were validated through chart review. Rates of SSI and associated risk factors were calculated using univariate regression analysis. Odds ratios were calculated through multivariate logistic regression.A total of 6628 hospital visits were identified. The cumulative incidence of SSI was 2.9%. Procedural risk factors associated with a statistically significant increase in rates of infection were the following: sacral involvement (9.6%), fusions greater than 7 levels (7.8%), fusions greater than 12 levels (10.4%), cases with an osteotomy (6.5%), operative time longer than 5 hours (5.1%), transfusions of red blood cells (5.0%), serum (7.4%), and autologous blood (4.1%). Patient-based risk factors included anemia (4.3%), diabetes mellitus (4.2%), coronary artery disease (4.7%), diagnosis of coagulopathy (7.8%), and bone or connective tissue neoplasm (5.0%).Used individually, diagnosis-related group, current procedural terminology, and ICD-9 codes cannot completely capture a patient population. Using an algorithm combining all 3 coding systems to generate both inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to analyze a specific population of spinal surgery patients within a high-volume medical center. Within that group, risk factors found to increase infection rates were isolated and can serve to focus hospital-wide efforts to decrease surgery-related morbidity and improve patient outcomes.",OpenAlex,0,0,11,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,16.5

We evaluated the use of automated inpatient diagnosis codes and pharmacy data to identify SSIs after arthroplasty.This retrospective cohort study at 8 hospitals involved weighted, random samples of medical records from 2128 total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures performed from 1 July 2002 through 30 June 2004, and 4194 total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures performed from 1 July 2003 through 30 June 2005. We compared routine surveillance with screening of inpatient pharmacy data and diagnoses codes followed by medical record review to confirm SSI status.Records from 696 THA and 1009 TKA procedures were reviewed. The SSI rates were nearly double those determined by routine surveillance (1.32% [95% confidence interval, 0.83%-1.81%] vs. 0.75% for THA; 1.83% [95% confidence interval, 1.43%-2.23%] vs. 0.71% for TKA). An inpatient diagnosis code for infection within a year after the operation had substantially higher sensitivity (THA, 89%; TKA, 81%), compared with routine surveillance (THA, 56%; TKA, 39%). Adding antimicrobial exposure of 7 days after the procedure increased the sensitivity (THA, 93%; TKA, 86%). Record review confirmed SSIs after 51% of THAs and 55% of TKAs that met diagnosis code criteria and after 25% of THAs and 39% of TKAs that met antimicrobial exposure and/or diagnosis code criteria.Focused surveillance among a subset of patients who met diagnosis code screening criteria with or without the addition of antimicrobial exposure-based screening was more sensitive than routine surveillance for detecting SSIs after arthroplasty and could be an efficient and readily standardized adjunct to traditional methods.",OpenAlex,0,0,6,3,0,2,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,infection,antimicrobial,18.0

Self-reporting patient measures are needed because current SSI tools are limited for assessing patients after leaving hospital. The Bluebelle Wound Healing Questionnaire (WHQ) was developed for patient or observer completion; this study tested its acceptability, scale structure, reliability and validity in patients with closed primary wounds after abdominal surgery. Methods Patients completed the WHQ (self-assessment) within 30 days after leaving hospital and returned it by post. Healthcare professionals completed the WHQ (observer assessment) by telephone or face-to-face. Questionnaire response rates and patient acceptability were assessed. Factor analysis and Cronbach's α examined scale structure and internal consistency. Test–retest and self- versus observer reliability assessments were performed. Sensitivity and specificity for SSI discrimination against a face-to-face reference diagnosis (using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria) were examined. Results Some 561 of 792 self-assessments (70·8 per cent) and 597 of 791 observer assessments (75·5 per cent) were completed, with few missing data or problems reported. Data supported a single-scale structure with strong internal consistency (α greater than 0·8). Reliability between test–retest and self- versus observer assessments was good (κ 0·6 or above for the majority of items). Sensitivity and specificity for SSI discrimination was high (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 0·91).

The authors report results on a new robotic kidney transplantation technique for obese patients that has comparable patient outcomes compared to an open procedure. Obese patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are often excluded from kidney transplantation due to concerns about surgical site infections. To reduce infections, we developed a robotic kidney transplantation method for obese recipients. From June 2009 to December 2011, a prospective cohort of 39 obese patients underwent robotic kidney transplantation at a single center. The outcomes of patients with at least 6 months of follow-up (n = 28) were compared to a frequency-matched retrospective cohort of obese patients who underwent open kidney transplantation from 2004 to 2009 (n = 28). The 28 robotic patients were predominately African American (46.4%) or Hispanic (35.7%), with a mean age of 47.9 ± 10.7 years, similar to the control group. BMI in the robotic group was 42.6 ± 7.8 kg/m2 compared to 38.1 ± 5.4 kg/m2 in the control group (p = 0.02). There were no surgical site infections in the robotic group (0/28), while 28.6% (8/28) in the control group developed an infection (p = 0.004). Six-month creatinine (1.5 ± 0.4 vs. 1.6 ± 0.6 mg/dL; p = 0.47), and patient and graft survival (100%) were comparable between the two groups. Outcomes following robotic surgery compared favorably to conventional transplantation. Robotic surgery may therefore enable obese patients with ESRD to access kidney transplantation and may thereby reduce health disparities in groups with a high prevalence of obesity and ESRD. Epidemiological data indicate that 20–50% of patients on dialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2) (1U.S. Renal Data System.

Higher BMIs in kidney transplant recipients are associated with excess risk of surgical site infections (SSIs), which negatively impact graft survival (8Lynch RJ Ranney DN Shijie C Lee DS Samala N Englesbe MJ Obesity, surgical site infection, and outcome following renal transplantation.Ann Surg. 2009; 250: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Obesity is also associated with comorbidities such as diabetes, although data on whether obesity increases mortality in kidney transplanted patients remain unclear (8Lynch RJ Ranney DN Shijie C Lee DS Samala N Englesbe MJ Obesity, surgical site infection, and outcome following renal transplantation.Ann Surg. 2009; 250: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,9Aalten J Christiaans MH de Fijter H et al.The influence of obesity on short- and long-term graft and patient survival after renal transplantation.Transpl Int. 2006; 19: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Provider perceptions of these risks accompanied by the expectation of some centers to give obese patients time to lose weight are the main reasons why a number of transplant centers are reluctant to list obese patients for transplantation (2Segev DL Simpkins CE Thompson RE Locke JE Warren DS Montgomery RA Obesity impacts access to kidney transplantation.J Am Soc Nephrol. 2008; 19: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,10Pham PT Pham PA Pham PC Parikh S Danovitch G Evaluation of adult kidney transplant candidates.Semin Dial. 2010; 23: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, many of these obese patients have diabetes and hypertension likely secondary to their obesity (11Sugerman HJ Wolfe LG Sica DA Clore JN Diabetes and hypertension in severe obesity and effects of gastric bypass-induced weight loss.Ann Surg. 2003; 237: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and such patients who remain on dialysis have a very high mortality rate.

To efficiently validate the accuracy of surgical site infection (SSI) data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) by New York State (NYS) hospitals. Design. Validation study. Setting. 176 NYS hospitals. Methods. NYS Department of Health staff validated the data reported to NHSN by review of a stratified sample of medical records from each hospital. The four strata were (1) SSIs reported to NHSN; (2) records with an indication of infection from diagnosis codes in administrative data but not reported to NHSN as SSIs; (3) records with discordant procedure codes in NHSN and state data sets; (4) records not in the other three strata. Results. A total of 7,059 surgical charts (6% of the procedures reported by hospitals) were reviewed. In stratum 1, 7% of reported SSIs did not meet the criteria for inclusion in NHSN and were subsequently removed. In stratum 2, 24% of records indicated missed SSIs not reported to NHSN, whereas in strata 3 and 4, only 1% of records indicated missed SSIs; these SSIs were subsequently added to NHSN.

Despite this, few studies have been published on this topic. We performed a retrospective study to determine the incidence of and factors associated with SSIs after intracranial surgery for craniofacial malformations at a single multidisciplinary craniofacial center during a 6-year period. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on 254 patients who underwent 281 intracranial procedures during a 6-year period. Patients with SSIs (cases) were compared with those without SSIs (controls). National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System criteria were used to identify cases of SSI. RESULTS: SSIs occurred in 9 (3.2%) of 281 intracranial procedures that took place during the study period. Factors associated with an SSI included a complicated diagnosis comprising a diagnosis of syndromic craniosynostosis, frontonasal dysplasia, or oblique facial cleft (odds ratio [OR], 13.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6–64.4); duration of surgery longer than 426 minutes (OR, 12.1; 95% CI, 2.4–59.9); closure of skin under tension (OR, 12.5; 95% CI, 3.0–52.6); use of bovine pericardium (OR and 95% CI undefined); more than four surgeons present during surgery (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.2–32); pediatric intensive care unit stay longer than 2 days (OR, 10.8; 95% CI, 2.2–53.3); and use of a ventilator after surgery (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.2–18.6). CONCLUSION: In this study, the presence of a complicated diagnosis and a number of other factors were associated with an SSI after pediatric intracranial surgery for craniofacial malformations. We speculate that a complicated diagnosis may be a marker for other factors that contribute to the risk of an SSI.

Understanding key social and contextual components of surgical staff behaviour may help to design and implement infection control (IC) improvement interventions in surgery. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with surgeons (n = 8), nurses (n = 5) theatre personnel (n = 3), and other healthcare professionals involved in surgery (n = 4) in a 1500-bed acute care London hospital group. Participants were approached through established mailing lists and snowball sampling. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analysed thematically using a constant comparative approach. IC behaviour of surgical staff was governed by factors at individual, team, and wider hospital level. IC practices were linked to the perceived risk of harm caused by an SSI more than the development of an SSI alone. Many operating room participants saw SSI prevention as a team responsibility. The sense of ownership over SSI occurence was closely tied to how preventable staff perceived infections to be, with differences observed between clean and contaminated surgery. However, senior surgeons claimed personal accountability for rates despite feeling SSIs are often not preventable. Hierarchy impacted on behaviour in different ways depending on whether it was within or between professional categories. One particular knowledge gap highlighted was the lack of awareness regarding criteria for SSI diagnosis. To influence IC behaviours in surgery, interventions need to consider the social team structure and shared ownership of the clinical outcome in order to increase the awareness in specialties where SSIs are not seen as serious complications.",OpenAlex,0,0,10,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,16.0

Aim To improve the predictive performance of an individual-based SSI risk model by considering a multilevel hierarchical structure. Patients and Methods Data were collected anonymously by the French SSI active surveillance system in 2011. An SSI diagnosis was made by the surgical teams and infection control practitioners following standardized criteria. A random 20% sample comprising 151 hospitals, 502 wards and 62280 patients was used. Three-level (patient, ward, hospital) hierarchical logistic regression models were initially performed. Parameters were estimated using the simulation-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure. Results A total of 623 SSI were diagnosed (1%). The hospital level was discarded from the analysis as it did not contribute to variability of SSI occurrence (p = 0.32). Established individual risk factors (patient history, surgical procedure and hospitalization characteristics) were identified. A significant heterogeneity in SSI occurrence between wards was found (median odds ratio [MOR] 3.59, 95% credibility interval [CI] 3.03 to 4.33) after adjusting for patient-level variables. The effects of the follow-up duration varied between wards (p<10−9), with an increased heterogeneity when follow-up was <15 days (MOR 6.92, 95% CI 5.31 to 9.07]). The final two-level model significantly improved the discriminative accuracy compared to the single level reference model (p<10−9), with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84.

Seventy-four infected patients (29%) and 46 uninfected patients (18%) required ICU admission (RR, 1.6; CI95, 1.3-2.0). The median length of hospitalization was 11 days for infected patients and 6 days for uninfected patients. The extra hospital stay attributable to SSI was 6.5 days (CI95, 5-8 days). The median direct costs of hospitalization were $7,531 for infected patients and $3,844 for uninfected patients. The excess direct costs attributable to SSI were $3,089 (CI95, $2,139-$4,163).

However, strong evidence supporting this association is lacking, and an exact definition of normothermia has not been described.To determine whether intraoperative hypothermia in patients who undergo segmental colectomy is associated with postoperative SSI.In a retrospective cohort study at a single tertiary-referral hospital, 296 adult patients who underwent elective segmental colectomy from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, were included. Exclusion criteria included postoperative stoma, emergent or urgent operation, and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.Perioperative temperature was measured continuously, and 4 possible definitions of hypothermia were explored, including temperature nadir, mean intraoperative temperature, percentage of time at the temperature nadir, and percentage of time with a temperature of less than 36.0°C.The primary outcome measure was 30-day SSI. Secondary outcome measures included clinical leak, return to the operating room, and nasogastric tube placement (a surrogate for ileus).The mean (SD) findings were as follows: intraoperative temperature, 35.9°C (0.6°C); temperature nadir, 34.3°C (2.8°C); percentage of time at the nadir, 4.7% (10.8%); and percentage of time with a temperature of less than 36.0°C, 49.9% (42.0%). The rate of SSI was 12.2% (n = 36). There was no statistically significant difference in temperature measurements between the patients who developed an SSI and those who did not. Logistic regression models evaluated each exposure measure and its effect on SSI, adjusting for body mass index, smoking status, and sex. The adjusted analyses revealed no association between intraoperative hypothermia and 30-day SSI (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.76-1.81; P = .48). Increased body mass index (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.10-1.76; P = .007) was significantly associated with SSI in all 4 logistic regression models.Patients who underwent segmental colectomy and sustained a period of intraoperative hypothermia were no more likely to develop an SSI than those who were normothermic.",OpenAlex,0,0,13,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,infection,none,22.5

Data were prospectively collected to identify demographic data, surgical operations, development of SSI, and outcomes of SSI. The study used one-to-one matched-pair strategy to compare case (patient with SSI) and controls (patient without SSI). The matching criteria were same final diagnosis, same operative procedure, and same American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. Data were calculated for mean difference, median difference, and 95% confidence intervals (95% C.I) of hospital charge and postoperative stay.The study could identify 140 matched-pairs of case and control. When compared to matched controls, cases had higher hospital charge and greater postoperative length of stay.

The bacterial pathogens implicated most frequently are Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) SSIs is increasing significantly. Since these infections have a significant impact on hospital budgets and patients' health, their diagnosis must be anticipated and therapy improved. The first step should be to evaluate risk factors for MRSA SSIs. Through a literature review, we identified possible major and minor risk factors for, and protective factors against MRSA SSIs. We then submitted statements on these factors to 228 Italian surgeons to determine, using the Delphi method, the degree of consensus regarding their importance. The consensus was rated as positive if >80% of the voters agreed with a statement and as negative if >80% of the voters disagreed. In other cases, no consensus was reached. There was positive consensus that sepsis, >2 weeks of hospitalization, age >75 years, colonization by MRSA, and diabetes were major risk factors for MRSA SSIs. Other possible major risk factors, on which a consensus was not reached, e.g., prior antibiotic use, were considered minor risk factors. Other minor risk factors were identified. An adequate antibiotic prophylaxis, laparoscopic technique, and infection committee surveillance were considered protective factors against MRSA SSIs. All these factors might be used to build predictive criteria for identifying SSI due to MRSA. In order to help to recognize and thus promptly initiate an adequate antibiotic therapy for MRSA SSIs, we designed a gradation of risk and protective factors. Validation, ideally prospective, of this score is now required. In the case of a SSI, if the risk that the infection is caused by MRSA is high, empiric antibiotic therapy should be started after debriding the wound and collecting material for culture.",OpenAlex,0,0,4,0,0,1,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,none,14.0

Methods: In this observational cohort, patients who underwent diverting loop ileostomy and elective ileostomy closure for any reason between September 2014 and July 2016 were enrolled. Irrigation of the surgical site with 0.05% CHG or saline were compared regarding post-operative incision complications. Infection risk was estimated by the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (NNIS) and Study of the Effect of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) scores. Post-operative follow-up was performed by a surgeon blinded to the treatment. Diagnosis of SSI was recorded according to the Guidelines for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection. Wound healing was evaluated by the Additional treatment, Serous discharge, Erythema, Purulent exudate, Separation of the deep tissues, Isolation of bacteria, and the duration of inpatient Stay (ASEPSIS) score. Results: There were 122 patients meeting the inclusion criteria: 60 in the saline (control) and 62 in the CHG (study) group. The mean age was 56.5 ± 13.5 (standard deviation [SD]); 74 patients were male. The groups were similar regarding age, sex, indication for ileostomy, neoadjuvant therapies, and SENIC and ASEPSIS scores. The overall SSI rate was 18%: 19 patients (31.6%) in the control group and 3 (4.8%) patients in the study group (p < 0.001). The mean ASEPSIS score was higher in the control group (12.8 ± 17.7) than in the study group (3.7 ± 7.8) (p < 0.001).

Active surveillance is an important component of surgical site infection (SSI) reduction strategy. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare SSI surveillance data in orthopedic patients in the Military Medical Academy (MMA), Belgrade. Methods. A 4-year prospective cohort study was performed to identify the incidence rate and risk factors for SSI in orthopedic patients in the MMA, Belgrade. We collected data regarding patients characteristics, health care and microorganisms isolated in SSI. The National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) risk index was subsequently calculated for each patient. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria were used for the diagnosis of SSI. Results. Assessment of 3,867 patients after different orthopedic operations revealed SSI in 109 patients. The overall incidence rate of SSI was 2.8% with the decrease from 4.6% in 2007 to 1.6% in 2010. Using NNIS risk index for surgical procedures there were: 53.7% (2,077) patients with risk 0 - the incidence rate of 1.4%; 38.9% (1,506) patients with risk 1 - the incidence rate of 3.1%; 7.3% (281) patients with risk 2 - the incidence rate of 11.7%; 0.1% (3) patients with risk 3 - without infection within the risk. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified 6 independent risk factors associated with SSI: contaminated or dirty wounds, smoking, preoperative infection, NNIS risk index, body mass index and the length of hospital stay.

While the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the most prevalent tool for surgical site infection (SSI) diagnosis, ASEPSIS and Southampton scoring methods have been speculated to be more sensitive. The ASEPSIS scoring system previously demonstrated much better interrater reliability than the CDC. We sought to assess the predictive value of various wound scoring methods in breast reconstruction SSIs. A retrospective analysis of all single-institution breast reconstruction infections from January 2013 to June 2016 was performed. Patients' postoperative wound-related complications were collected. Southampton, CDC, and modified ASEPSIS scores-extended to 30 postoperative days-were calculated. Relative predictive values for implant-based reconstruction were evaluated. Among the 22 reviewed cases, ASEPSIS scores greater than 30 resulted in a more than 50% rate of implant-based breast reconstruction failure. There was a significant positive correlation between ASEPSIS score and failure rate (P = .022). A Southampton classification of B-minor complication (60% failure)-had a greater associative risk of reconstruction failure than a classification of C-major complication (23% failure)-or classification of D-major hematoma (0% failure). The CDC score had no predictive value of success versus failure of reconstruction. While the CDC criteria and Southampton scoring systems demonstrated little clinical use, the ASEPSIS scoring system shows substantial predictive value for breast reconstruction SSIs. New procedure protocols should be implemented to require detailed surgical notes including the proportion of the wounds affected by inflammatory responses to allow for easier wound score calculation by these alternate scoring systems.L’infection est la principale complication en cas de reconstruction mammaire.

National guidelines currently recommend first-generation cephalosporins as first line prophylaxis. Due to an increase in MRSA cases in our institution, a combined antibiotic strategy using vancomycin IV, standard prophylactic antibiotics, and vancomycin powder was implemented for all spinal instrumentation surgeries. Methods: All spinal instrumentation surgeries performed at this institution from 2013–2016 were identified. Chart review was then performed to identify the inclusion and exclusion criteria, demographic data, diagnosis, type of surgery performed, and bacterial culture results. Rates of SSI, as defined by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), were calculated and antibiotic resistance was determined.

Of 2,490 abstracts identified to assess the definition of surgical wound infection, 90 prospective studies from 20 countries were included in the analysis. Forty-one different definitions of surgical wound or SSI were identified; some were “standard” definitions used by national surveillance programmes: the Public Health Laboratory Service (NPS), the Surgical Infection Society Study Group, the Second UK National Prevalence Survey, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 1988 and 1992 definitions. There was no single symptom common to all definitions, but the most common criteria of infection was purulent discharge. Received for publication: Sep. 11, 2009. Revised: Dec. 08, 2009. _____________________________ Alina Petrica et al 363 DEFINITIONS The most widely recognized definition of infection, used throughout the USA and Europe, is that devised by Horan and colleagues and adopted by the CDC.9 According to CDC definition, surgical site infections are classified into three groups – superficial, deep incisional SSIs and organ-space SSIs – depending on the site and the extent of infection. These definitions are summarized in Table 1. ASEPSIS is an acronym of seven wound assessment parameters. (Table 2) It’s a quantitative scoring method that provides a numerical score related to the severity of wound infection using objective criteria based on wound appearance and the clinical consequences of the infection.10,11 Table 1. CDC definitions of surgical site infections. The ASEPSIS system was ment to assess wounds resulting from cardiothoracic surgery, while the Southampton scale was designed for use in the postoperative assessment of hernia wounds. The Southampton system is much simpler than the ASEPSIS system, with wounds being categorized according to any complications and their extent.12 Both systems, however, have been developed for use following specific types of surgery and this may limit their usefulness.1 Southampton scale by using the worst wound score recorded and information about any treatment instituted either in hospital or the community, wounds were regarded in four categories: (Table 3) a. normal healing; b. minor complication; Table 1. CDC definitions of surgical site infections Superficial incisional surgical site infections Superficial incisional surgical site infections must meet the following two criteria2:  occur within 30 days of procedure  involve only the skin or subcutaneous tissue around the incision. Plus At least one of the following criteria:  purulent drainage from the incision  organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the incision  at least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection – pain or tenderness, localized swelling, redness or heat – and the incision is deliberately opened by a surgeon, unless the culture is negative  diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by a surgeon or attending physician. The following are not considered superficial SSIs:  stitch abscesses (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of suture penetration)  infection of an episiotomy or neonatal circumcision site  infected burn wounds  incisional SSIs that extend into the fascial and muscle layers (see deep SSIs). Deep incisional surgical site infections Deep incisional surgical site infections must meet the following three criteria2:  occur within 30 days of procedure (or one year in the case of implants)  are related to the procedure  involve deep soft tissues, such as the fascia and muscles.

The current commonly used definitions of SSI were devised more than two decades ago and do not take in to account more modern technology that could be used to make diagnosis more consistent and precise. Patient-generated health data (PGHD), including digital imaging, may be able to fulfill this objective. Methods: The published literature was examined to determine the current state of development in terms of using digital imaging as an aide to diagnose SSI. This information was used to devise possible methodology that could be used to integrate digital images to more objectively define SSI, as well as using these data for both surveillance activities and clinical management. Results: Digital imaging is a highly promising means to help define and diagnose SSI, particularly in remote settings. Multiple groups continue to actively study these emerging technologies, however, present methods remain based generally on subjective rather than objective observations. Although current images may be useful on a case-by-case basis, similar to physical examination information, integrating imaging in the definition of SSI to allow more automated diagnosis in the future will require complex image analysis combined with other available quantified data. Conclusions: Digital imaging technology, once adequately evolved, should become a cornerstone of the criteria for both the clinical and surveillance definitions of SSI.",OpenAlex,0,0,11,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,17.5

Furthermore, SSIs constitute a financial burden and negatively impact on patient quality of life (QoL).AimTo assess, and evaluate the evidence for, the cost and health-related QoL (HRQoL) burden of SSIs across various surgical specialties in six European countries.MethodsElectronic databases and conference proceedings were systematically searched to identify studies reporting the cost and HRQoL burden of SSIs. Studies published post 2005 in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and the UK were eligible for data extraction. Studies were categorized by surgical specialty, and the primary outcomes were the cost of infection, economic evaluations, and HRQoL.FindingsTwenty-six studies met the eligibility criteria and were included for analysis. There was a paucity of evidence in the countries of interest; however, SSIs were consistently associated with elevated costs, relative to uninfected patients. Several studies reported that SSI patients required prolonged hospitalization, reoperation, readmission, and that SSIs increased mortality rates. Only one study reported QoL evidence, the results of which demonstrated that SSIs reduced HRQoL scores (EQ-5D). Hospitalization reportedly constituted a substantial cost burden, with additional costs arising from medical staff, investigation, and treatment costs.ConclusionDisparate reporting of SSIs makes direct cost comparisons difficult, but this review indicated that SSIs are extremely costly. Thus, rigorous procedures must be implemented to minimize SSIs. More economic and QoL studies are required to make accurate cost estimates and to understand the true burden of SSIs.",OpenAlex,0,0,4,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,none,12.0

Like with all claims databases, there have been some validity concerns of studies using the NHIRD, such as the accuracy of diagnosis codes and issues around unmeasured confounders. Endeavors to validate diagnosed codes or to develop methodologic approaches to address unmeasured confounders have largely increased the reliability of NHIRD studies. Recently, Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) established a Health and Welfare Data Center (HWDC), a data repository site that centralizes the NHIRD and about 70 other health-related databases for data management and analyses. To strengthen the protection of data privacy, investigators are required to conduct on-site analysis at an HWDC through remote connection to MOHW servers. Although the tight regulation of this on-site analysis has led to inconvenience for analysts and has increased time and costs required for research, the HWDC has created opportunities for enriched dimensions of study by linking across the NHIRD and other databases. In the near future, researchers will have greater opportunity to distill knowledge from the NHIRD linked to hospital-based electronic medical records databases containing unstructured patient-level information by using artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning and natural language processes. We believe that NHIRD with multiple data sources could represent a powerful research engine with enriched dimensions and could serve as a guiding light for real-world evidence-based medicine in Taiwan.

Diagnosis of SSI was made as per CDC criteria. Various risk factors and impact of SSI on postoperative recovery were analysed. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS version 16.0. Range and mean was calculated for continuous variables and overall incidence rate of SSI is also calculated. Pearson Chi-square test was used to test risk factor association with SSI. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. Significance was assumed at a p value of less than 0.05.Results: The incidence of SSI was found to be 52 out of 285 women (46%). Majority of SSI, i.e. 49 out of 52 (94%) were superficial in nature. Deep SSI was seen in 3 patients (6%). No organ/space infection was noted in any patient. Women who were over 50 years had higher risk of developing SSI than women between 36 to 50 years (OR 0.519 Vs 0.214). The risk of SSI was 4 times in case of clean contaminated wounds as compared to clean wounds (OR 3.877). The risk further increased to 7 times in case of dirty wounds (OR 6.753). Other risk factors which are significantly associated with SSI were BMI (p value &lt;0.001), midline incisions (p &lt;0.001) and Mattress suture (p &lt;0.001). Presence of previous scar had intraoperative adhesions, weaker scar and poor healing which predispose to development of SSI. Comorbidities which influence SSI’s in the present study are diabetes mellitus (OR 5.49, 95% CI 2.506-12.066, P &lt;0.001), anaemia (OR 4.63, Cl 2.458-8.756) and hypertension (OR 2.46, Cl 0.994-6.117). Wound swab was sterile in 33(63%) cases and 18(35%) cases showed growth of the organism. Most common organism noted was E. coli 9 (50%) followed by Klebsiella and Staph aureus.Conclusions: SSIs are increasing in the current scenario due to increase in the number of surgeries, however they can be prevented by early identification and optimization of medical comorbidities and BMI. Meticulous preoperative workup and intraoperative surgical steps are important in reducing the risk of developing SSI. A decrease in infection rate can lead to substantial reduction in the burden of disease.",OpenAlex,0,0,19,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,infection,none,29.5

In an effort to catch all sternal wound complications, different postdischarge surveillance methods have to be used. Together with this long-term follow-up an analysis of risk factors may help to identify patients at risk and can lead to more effective preventive and control measures.This retrospective study of 3008 adult patients who underwent consecutive cardiac surgery from January 1996 through September 1999 at Linköping University Hospital, Sweden, evaluated 42 potential risk factors by univariate analysis followed by backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis.Two-thirds of the 291 (9.7%) sternal wound complications that occurred were identified after discharge. Of the 291 patients, 47 (1.6%) had deep sternal infections, 50 (1.7%) had postoperative mediastinitis, and 194 (6.4%) had superficial sternal wound complications. Twenty-three variables were selected by univariate analysis (P<0.15) and included in a multivariate analysis where eight variables emerged as significant (P<0.05). Preoperative risk factors for deep sternal infections/mediastinitis were obesity, insulin-dependent diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease, and high New York Heart Association score. An intraoperative risk factor was bilateral use of internal mammary arteries, and a postoperative risk factor was prolonged ventilator support. Risk factors for superficial sternal wound complications were obesity, and an age of <75 years. The 30 day mortality was 2.7% for patients without sternal wound complications and 2/291 (0.7%) for all patients with sternal wound complications, 0.5% for superficial sternal wound complications, and 1.0% for deep sternal infections/mediastinitis. The 1 year mortality rate was 4.8% for patients without sternal wound complications and 11/291 (3.8%) for patients with sternal wound complications, 2.1% for superficial sternal wound complications, and 7.2% for deep sternal infections/mediastinitis.The risk factors found in this study have been detected and reported in previous studies. The predictive ability was stronger though for deep sternal infections/mediastinitis (those needing surgical revisions) than for superficial sternal wound complications.

This research evaluates the incidence and outcome of SSI and graft infection in open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery.A retrospective study was performed, including all patients who underwent surgery for aortoiliac aneurysmatic disease between January 2000 and December 2016 in the Amphia Hospital, Breda, The Netherlands. Surgical site infections were defined in accordance with criteria of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Aortic graft infection was diagnosed by a combination of computed tomography imaging and microbiologic results.Between January 2000 and December 2016, 845 patients (mean age, 72.80 ± 7.15 y, 86.3% male) underwent abdominal aneurysm surgery (477 endovascular, 368 open). The total SSI rate was 3.1% (12 endovascular [2.5%], 14 open [3.8%], p = 0.318) with 0.8% deep SSI (26.9% of SSIs). No difference in SSIs was found between acute and elective surgery (2.9% vs. 3.1%, p = 1.000). Patients with SSI had a longer duration of stay (mean, 27.65 ± 30.74 d vs. 9.79 ± 12.50 d, p < 0.0001) but no difference in 30-day or 1-year mortality. Twenty-four graft infections occurred (4.3% of open vs. 1.7% of endovascular surgery, p = 0.023) of which 20 (83.3%) required surgery. Two-year mortality was higher when graft infections occurred (33.3% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.046). Surgical site infections (odds ratio [OR] 7.10, 95% [CI] 2.10-23.98) and mycotic aneurysms (OR 9.38, 95% CI 1.78-54.19) are independent determinants for graft infections.This study shows that SSIs after endovascular aortic surgery are as common as after open aortic surgery. Furthermore, this study supports the concept that aortic graft infection is highly associated with SSIs and mycotic aneurysms.

According to the results of high-ranking scientific studies published in peer-reviewed journals, statements and recommendations are formulated, and these are graded strictly according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine. Guidelines can therefore be valuable in helping particularly the young surgeon in his or her day-to-day work to find the best decision for the patient when confronted with a wide and confusing range of options. However, even experienced surgeons benefit because by virtue of a heavy workload and commitment, they often find it difficult to keep up with the ever-increasing published literature.

During the study period, 464 wrist arthroscopies were performed, of these 178 soft-tissue-only interventions met the study criteria and were included. Signs of postoperative infection and possible adverse drug effects (ADEs) of PAP were monitored.

In practice, single‐dose prophylaxis has not been universally accepted and multiple‐dose regimens are still used in some centres. Moreover, the principle has recently been challenged by the results of an Australian study of vascular surgery. The aim of this current systematic review is to determine the overall efficacy of single versus multiple–dose antimicrobial prophylaxis for major surgery and across surgical disciplines. Methods: Relevant studies were identified in the medical literature using the MEDLINE database and other search strategies. Trials included in the review were prospective and randomized, had the same antimicrobial in each treatment arm and were published in English. Rates of postoperative surgical site infections (SSI) were extracted, 2 × 2 tables prepared and odds ratios (OR) [with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)] calculated. Data were then combined using fixed and random effects models to provide an overall figure. In this context, high value for the combined OR, with 95% CI &gt; 1.0, indicates superiority of multiple–dose regimens and low OR, with 95% CI &lt; 1.0, suggests the opposite. A combined OR close to 1.0, with narrow 95% CI straddling 1.0, indicates no clear advantage of one regimen over another. Further subgroup analyses were also performed. Results: Combined OR by both fixed (1.06,95% CI, 0.89–1.25) and random effects (1.04, 95% CI, 0.86–1.25) models indicated no clear advantage of either single or multiple‐dose regimens in preventing SSI. Likewise, subgroup analysis showed no statistically significant differences associated with type of antimicrobial used (beta‐lactam vs other), blinded wound assessment, length of the multiple–dose arm (&gt; 24 h vs 24 h or less) or type of surgery (obstetric and gynaecological vs other).

We developed an electronic surveillance algorithm to identify patients with SSIs. Our objective was to validate our algorithm by comparing it with our institutional National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (NSQIP Peds) data. Methods We applied our algorithm to our institutional NSQIP Peds 2015–2017 cohort. The algorithm consisted of the presence of a diagnosis code for post-operative infection or the presence of 4 criteria: diagnosis code for infection, antibiotic administration, positive culture, and readmission/surgery related to infection. We compared the algorithm’s SSI rate to the NSQIP Peds identified SSI. Algorithm performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and Cohen’s kappa. The charts of discordant patients were reviewed to understand limitations of the algorithm. Results Of 3879 patients included, 2.5% had SSIs by NSQIP Peds definition and 1.9% had SSIs by our algorithm. Our algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 44%, specificity of 99%, NPV of 99%, PPV of 59%, and Cohen’s kappa of 0.5. Of the 54 false negatives, 37% were diagnosed/treated as outpatients, 31% had tracheitis, and 17% developed SSIs during their post-operative admission. Of the 30 false positives, 33% had an infection at index surgery and 33% had SSIs related to other surgeries/procedures.

Diagnosis of AA is challenging; a variable combination of clinical signs and symptoms has been used together with laboratory findings in several scoring systems proposed for suggesting the probability of AA and the possible subsequent management pathway. The role of imaging in the diagnosis of AA is still debated, with variable use of US, CT and MRI in different settings worldwide. Up to date, comprehensive clinical guidelines for diagnosis and management of AA have never been issued. In July 2015, during the 3rd World Congress of the WSES, held in Jerusalem (Israel), a panel of experts including an Organizational Committee and Scientific Committee and Scientific Secretariat, participated to a Consensus Conference where eight panelists presented a number of statements developed for each of the eight main questions about diagnosis and management of AA. The statements were then voted, eventually modified and finally approved by the participants to The Consensus Conference and lately by the board of co-authors. The current paper is reporting the definitive Guidelines Statements on each of the following topics: 1) Diagnostic efficiency of clinical scoring systems, 2) Role of Imaging, 3) Non-operative treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis, 4) Timing of appendectomy and in-hospital delay, 5) Surgical treatment 6) Scoring systems for intra-operative grading of appendicitis and their clinical usefulness 7) Non-surgical treatment for complicated appendicitis: abscess or phlegmon 8) Pre-operative and post-operative antibiotics.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,2.5

Objectives To investigate the interobserver agreement between dermatologists in their diagnosis of SSI of dermatosurgical wounds. Methods An international electronic photographic survey with eight photographs of wounds 1 week after full-thickness skin grafting (FTSG) was sent to dermatologists. All wounds were assessed in terms of visual criteria beforehand. Data collected from respondents included physician characteristics and experience, and SSI assessments of all wounds. Results In total, 393 dermatologists from 27 countries enrolled. Most respondents were from the U.S.A. (25%), followed by Sweden (24%) and the U.K. (13%). There was only a slight interobserver agreement on SSI suspicion (kappa = 0 center dot 19). SSI suspicion was lower for male physicians (P = 0 center dot 03), board-certified dermatologists (P = 0 center dot 001), physicians regularly assessing surgical wounds (P = 0 center dot 03) and physicians performing FTSG (P < 0 center dot 001). Swedish physicians diagnosed more SSIs than U.S. physicians (P = 0 center dot 002). Erythema was more common in cases with higher SSI suspicion.

In this first Scientific Statement of The Endocrine Society, we present the evidence that endocrine disruptors have effects on male and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology. Results from animal models, human clinical observations, and epidemiological studies converge to implicate EDCs as a significant concern to public health. The mechanisms of EDCs involve divergent pathways including (but not limited to) estrogenic, antiandrogenic, thyroid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, retinoid, and actions through other nuclear receptors; steroidogenic enzymes; neurotransmitter receptors and systems; and many other pathways that are highly conserved in wildlife and humans, and which can be modeled in laboratory in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, EDCs represent a broad class of molecules such as organochlorinated pesticides and industrial chemicals, plastics and plasticizers, fuels, and many other chemicals that are present in the environment or are in widespread use. We make a number of recommendations to increase understanding of effects of EDCs, including enhancing increased basic and clinical research, invoking the precautionary principle, and advocating involvement of individual and scientific society stakeholders in communicating and implementing changes in public policy and awareness.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

There is no baseline information regarding SSI in our setting therefore it was necessary to conduct this study to establish the prevalence, pattern and predictors of surgical site infection at Bugando Medical Centre Mwanza (BMC), Tanzania. Methods This was a cross-sectional prospective study involving all patients who underwent major surgery in surgical wards between July 2009 and March 2010. After informed written consent for the study and HIV testing, all patients who met inclusion criteria were consecutively enrolled into the study. Pre-operative, intra-operative and post operative data were collected using standardized data collection form. Wound specimens were collected and processed as per standard operative procedures; and susceptibility testing was done using disc diffusion technique. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 15 and STATA. Results Surgical site infection (SSI) was detected in 65 (26.0%) patients, of whom 56 (86.2%) and 9 (13.8%) had superficial and deep SSI respectively. Among 65 patients with clinical SSI, 56(86.2%) had positive aerobic culture. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant organism 16/56 (28.6%); of which 3/16 (18.8%) were MRSA. This was followed by Escherichia coli 14/56 (25%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae 10/56 (17.9%). Among the Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates 9(64.3%) and 8(80%) were ESBL producers respectively.

However, as critical outcomes include: (i) incidence and cost data that substantiate the problems, and (ii) establishment of research priorities; an ICM 2018 research workgroup (RW) was assembled to accomplish these tasks. Here, we present the result of the RW consensus on the current and projected incidence of infection, and the costs per patient, for all orthopedic subspecialties, which range from 0.1% to 30%, and $17,000 to $150,000. The RW also identified the most important research questions. The Delphi methodology was utilized to initially derive four objective criteria to define a subset of the 164 GA questions that are high priority for future research. Thirty‐eight questions (23% of all GA questions) achieved the requisite &gt; 70% agreement vote, and are highlighted in this Consensus article within six thematic categories: acute versus chronic infection, host immunity, antibiotics, diagnosis, research caveats, and modifiable factors. Finally, the RW emphasizes that without appropriate funding to address these high priority research questions, a 3rd ICM on MSKI to address similar issues at greater cost is inevitable.",OpenAlex,0,0,4,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,7.0

Background: Locally advanced rectal cancer is usually treated with preoperative CRT followed by surgery approximately 6 weeks later. The Timing of Rectal Cancer Response to Chemoradiation Consortium designed a prospective, multicenter, Phase II clinical trial to investigate extending the interval between CRT and surgery, and administering additional chemotherapy during the waiting period. Here, we present preliminary results of this trial, reporting the tumor response, CRT-related toxicity and surgical complications. Methods: Stage II and III rectal cancer patients were treated concurrently with 5-Fluorouracil (FU) and radiation for 5 to 6 weeks. Patients in study group (SG) 1 underwent total mesorectal excision (TME) 6 weeks later. Patients in SG2 with evidence of a clinical response 4 weeks after CRT received 2 cycles of modified FOLFOX-6 (mFOLFOX-6) followed by TME 3 to 5 weeks later. Tumor response, CRT-related toxicity and surgical complications were recorded. Results: One hundred and forty-four patients were accrued. One hundred and thirty-six (66, SG1; 70, SG2) were evaluated for CRT-related toxicity. One hundred and twenty-seven (60, SG1; 67, SG2) were assessed for tumor response and surgical complications. A similar proportion of patients completed CRT per protocol in both SGs, but the cumulative dose of sensitizing 5-FU and radiation was higher in SG2. CRT-related toxicity was comparable between SGs. Average time from CRT-to-surgery was 6 (SG1) and 11 weeks (SG2). Pathologic complete response (pCR) was 18% (SG1) and 25% (SG2). Postoperative complications were similar between SGs. Conclusions: Intense neoadjuvant therapy consisting of CRT followed by additional chemotherapy (mFOLFOX-6), and delaying surgery may result in a modest increase in pCR rate without increasing complications in patients undergoing TME for locally advanced rectal cancer.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,3.0

The global trend towards reducing length of hospital stay post-surgery and the increase in day case surgery means that surgical site infections (SSI) will increasingly occur after hospital discharge. Surveillance of SSIs is important because rates of SSI are viewed as a measure of hospital performance, however accurate detection of SSIs post-hospital discharge is not straightforward. We conducted a systematic review of methods of post discharge surveillance for surgical wound infection and undertook a national audit of methods of post-discharge surveillance for surgical site infection currently used within United Kingdom NHS Trusts. Seven reports of six comparative studies which examined the validity of post-discharge surveillance methods were located; these involved different comparisons and some had methodological limitations, making it difficult to identify an optimal method. Several studies evaluated automated screening of electronic records and found this to be a useful strategy for the identification of SSIs that occurred post discharge. The audit identified a wide range of relevant post-discharge surveillance programmes in England, Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland; however, these programmes used varying approaches for which there is little supporting evidence of validity and/or reliability. In order to establish robust methods of surveillance for those surgical site infections that occur post discharge, there is a need to develop a method of case ascertainment that is valid and reliable post discharge. Existing research has not identified a valid and reliable method. A standardised definition of wound infection (e.g. that of the Centres for Disease Control) should be used as a basis for developing a feasible, valid and reliable approach to defining post discharge SSI. At a local level, the method used to ascertain post discharge SSI will depend upon the purpose of the surveillance, the nature of available routine data and the resources available.",OpenAlex,0,0,12,0,0,1,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,none,26.0

Any complication leading to an unplanned revision surgery is therefore undesirable. The percentage of complications referred to in publications on this topic focusing on unplanned revision surgeries only varies from 0.7% to 29.8%, with obvious diversity of causes and significant risk factors. The purpose of the submitted paper is to carry out a prospective evaluation of the most serious complications requiring unplanned revision spinal surgeries in the course of 13 years at a single department performing a broad range of spinal surgeries, namely 1300 procedures annually on average. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period 2006 - 2018, a total of 16872 patients underwent a surgery at our department. During this period, in 556 patients an unplanned revision spinal surgery was performed. In agreement with literature, the patients were categorised by cause for revision: 1/ impaired wound suprafascial (superficial) healing - superficial infection, 2/ impaired wound subfascial (deep) healing - deep infection, 3/ surgical wound hematoma, 4/ deterioration or occurrence of new neurological symptoms, 5/ cerebrospinal fluid leak (liquorrhoea) and 6/ others. The patients operated on for inflammatory diseases of the spine with subsequent infectious complications, primarily treated at another department, and the patients with open spinal injury were excluded from the study. According to these criteria, a cohort of 521 patients was followed up, namely 236 (45.3%) women and 285 (54.7%) men, aged 1 year to 86 years, with the mean age of 55.0 years (median 60 years). Demographic effects, tobacco smoking and comorbidities were followed up in the cohort, together with the effects of surgery, diagnosis, surgical approach and physician. All parameters were statistically evaluated at a p-value below 0.05, including comparison with the control group. RESULTS Of the total number of 16872 operated patients, a group of 521 (3.09%) patients undergoing a revision surgery for complications was analysed in detail. Impaired wound healing - infection (SSI) was found in 199 (1.18%) patients, of whom superficial infection in 124 cases (0.73%) and deep infection in 75 cases (0.44%). Hematoma in a surgical site was detected in 149 (0.88%) patients. In 63 (0.37%) cases, deterioration of the existing neurological finding or occurrence of a new neurological finding were observed, in 68 (0.40%) cases cerebrospinal fluid leak was reported and in 40 (0.24%) cases other complications were identified. As concerns the surgical assistant, the percentage of complications in a board-certified physician is 2.77 (1.14 - 3.29%), in a medical resident it increases to 3.60 (0.00 - 9.38%) (p<0.05). The prevalence of smokers in the group with complications (N=521) was 34.7%. The control group (N=3650) included 30.1% of smokers (p<0.05). The mean age of patients in the group with complications (N=521) was higher, i.e. 55.0 years, with the median age of 60.0 years, than in the primary cohort (N=16872) with the mean age of 49.8 years and the median age of 52.0 years (p<0.05). The mean BMI in the group with complications was (N=521) 27.3, the median BMI was 26.9. In the control group (N=16872), the mean BMI was 27.11, the median BMI was 26.8. In this case the significance (p>0.05) was not confirmed. The complications prevailed strongly in posterior surgical approach, namely in 483 patients (92.7%). As concerns the surgically treated segment, lumber spine dominates with 320 (61.4%) cases. Corticosteroid therapy was used twice as often in women, namely in 13.1% vs. 6.3%. The group of patients with complications (N=521) showed a much higher average length of hospital stay of 12.8 days compared to the average of 4.6 days (N=16872). DISCUSSION In our cohort, the complication rate was 3.09%, of which infections constituted 1.18%, which is in agreement with similarly focused papers. As regards the patient-related factors, in our study the results reported by literature were confirmed with respect to the age, smoking and comorbidities. Moreover, the posterior surgical procedure, lumber spine surgery and presence of a medical resident are essential (p<0.05). No major age difference was observed between women and men (p>0.05). Obesity is one of the key risk factors, especially in infectious complications. In our cohort, a higher BMI did not increase the risk of complications in general (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS In correlation with current literature, our cohort confirmed a significantly higher risk of complications leading to revision spinal surgery associated with age, smoking, posterior surgical procedure in thoracic or lumber spine, and presence of a medical resident as a surgical assistant. The average length of hospital stay was demonstrably longer in complicated patients, it almost tripled compared to the whole cohort. Contrary to literature, the effect of obesity on the occurrence of complications was not confirmed.

A prospective cohort study,Acta Obstetricia Et Gynecologica Scandinavica,2007.0,"The aim of this study was to document the true incidence of post-cesarean surgical site infections (SSI), according to the definition of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and to identify independent risk factors for infection.Prospective population-based cohort study in Norway. Setting. Sykehuset Asker og Baerum HF, a secondary community hospital, associated with the University of Oslo (UiO), Norway, accounting for 2,000 deliveries per year. Participants. All cesarean deliveries during a 12-month period from September 2003. Main outcome measures. Rate and risk factors for SSI.The total rate of SSI was 8.9%, with an observation period of 30 days post-operatively, compared to 1.8% registered at hospital discharge. The total response rate was 100%. There was no significant difference in SSI rate in elective or emergency cesarean section (CS), respectively. All SSI were superficial. We found 2 significant independent risk factors: operating time > or =38 min and body mass index (BMI) >30.The rate of SSI is underestimated if the observation time is limited to the hospital stay. Operating time exceeding 38 min substantially increases the risk of SSI. The finding of no significant difference in SSI rate between elective and emergency CS should lead to a different approach concerning the use of antibiotics: subgroup at risk (operating time > or =38 min and BMI >30) may benefit from antibiotics in relation to the operation, whether the CS is an emergency or elective operation.",OpenAlex,0,0,9,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,infection,none,13.5

However, it is well known that the transoperative period is recognized as one of the most critical moments for the prevention of SSI. Objective: We evaluated the knowledge of the operating room (OR) nurse coordinators regarding SSI prevention measures. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 30 large hospitals in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from February 2018 to April 2019. Data were collected through interviews with OR nurse coordinators. Results: Administration time of prophylactic antibiotic administered between 30 and 60 minutes prior to surgery was reported by 84% of the professionals and the suspension of this agent in the first 24 hours was reported by 47.8%. Preoperative hair removal within the operating room was mentioned by 60% of respondents and 36.7% mentioned using a razor. The Safe Surgery program of the WHO was unknown to 6.7% of nurses. Among those who knew about it, 20.8% stated that there was no surgical site demarcation. Presentation of the surgical team occurred before the beginning of the procedure in only 53.3% of the institutions. Patient surveillance for SSI was reported by 93.3% of respondents, but the criteria adopted for the diagnosis of SSI were unknown, even though SSI rates were given for 90% of services, predominantly via meetings (53.5%). Conclusions: The knowledge of nurses related to the prevention of SSI was not satisfactory, pointing to the need for immediate efforts in education and awareness programs. Such programs may facilitate changes in practice through the recognition of surgical patient risk by these professionals, thus leading to better planning and practice during the trans-operative period.

Previously published data have provided conflicting conclusions. Methodology We conducted a multi-center matched outcomes study of 659 surgical patients. Patients with SSI due to MRSA were compared with two groups: matched uninfected control patients and patients with SSI due to MSSA. Four outcomes were analyzed for the 90-day period following diagnosis of the SSI: mortality, readmission, duration of hospitalization, and hospital charges. Attributable outcomes were determined by logistic and linear regression. Principal Findings In total, 150 patients with SSI due to MRSA were compared to 231 uninfected controls and 128 patients with SSI due to MSSA. SSI due to MRSA was independently predictive of readmission within 90 days (OR = 35.0, 95% CI 17.3–70.7), death within 90 days (OR = 7.27, 95% CI 2.83–18.7), and led to 23 days (95% CI 19.7–26.3) of additional hospitalization and $61,681 (95% 23,352–100,011) of additional charges compared with uninfected controls. Methicillin-resistance was not independently associated with increased mortality (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 0.70–4.20) nor likelihood of readmission (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.21–0.89) but was associated with 5.5 days (95% CI 1.97–9.11) of additional hospitalization and $24,113 (95% 4,521–43,704) of additional charges. Conclusions/Significance The attributable impact of S. aureus and methicillin-resistance on outcomes of surgical patients is substantial.

This group identified 22 ERAS items for lumbar fusion. A systematic search in the English language was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and cohort studies were included, and the evidence was graded according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Consensus recommendation was reached by the group after a critical appraisal of the literature.Two hundred fifty-six articles were included to develop the consensus statements for 22 ERAS items; one ERAS item (prehabilitation) was excluded from the final summary due to very poor quality and conflicting evidence in lumbar spinal fusion. From these remaining 21 ERAS items, 28 recommendations were included. All recommendations on ERAS protocol items are based on the best available evidence. These included nine preoperative, eleven intraoperative, and six postoperative recommendations. They span topics from preoperative patient education and nutritional evaluation, intraoperative anesthetic and surgical techniques, and postoperative multimodal analgesic strategies.

Hospital readmission rates are used to measure hospital performance, but risk factors (both medical and surgical) for readmission after TKA, revision TKA, and treatment for the infected TKA have not been well characterized.We measured (1) the unplanned hospital readmission rate in primary TKA and revision TKA, including antibiotic-spacer staged revision TKA to treat infection. We also evaluated (2) the medical and surgical causes of readmission and (3) risk factors associated with unplanned hospital readmission.This retrospective cohort study included a total of 1408 patients (1032 primary TKAs, 262 revision TKAs, 113 revision of infected TKAs) from one institution. All hospital readmissions within 90 days of discharge were evaluated for timing and cause. Diagnoses at readmission were categorized as surgical or medical. Readmission risk was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model that incorporated patient demographics and medical comorbidities.The unplanned readmission rate for the entire cohort was 4% at 30 days and 8% at 90 days. At 90 days postoperatively, revision of an infected TKA had the highest readmission rate, followed by revision TKA, with primary TKA having the lowest rate. Approximately three-fourths of readmissions were the result of surgical causes, mostly infection, arthrofibrosis, and cellulitis, whereas the remainder of readmissions were the result of medical causes. Procedure type (primary TKA versus revision TKA or staged treatment for infected TKA), hospital stay more than 5 days, discharge destination, and a fluid/electrolyte abnormality were each associated with risk of unplanned readmission.Patients having revision TKA, whether for infection or other causes, are more likely to have an unplanned readmission to the hospital than are patients having primary TKA.

The added value of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and 18 F-FDG PET/CT angiography (PET/CTA) was evaluated in this complex scenario at a referral center with a multidisciplinary IE unit. Methods and Results— Ninety-two patients admitted to our hospital with suspected prosthetic valve or cardiac device IE between November 2012 and November 2014 were prospectively included. All patients underwent echocardiography and PET/CT, and 76 had cardiac CTA. PET/CT and echocardiography findings were evaluated and compared, with concordant results in 54% of cases (κ=0.23). Initial diagnoses with DC at admission, PET/CT, and DC+PET/CT were compared with the final diagnostic consensus reached by the IE Unit. DC+PET/CT enabled reclassification of 90% of cases initially classified as possible IE with DC and provided a conclusive diagnosis (definite/rejected) in 95% of cases.

Main Outcome Measures:We compared 30-day SSI rates among obese and nonobese patients and calculated total costs from all health care claims for 90 days following surgery.Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for SSIs.Results: Obese patients had an increased rate of SSI compared with nonobese patients (14.5% vs 9.5%, respectively; PϽ.001).Independent risk factors for these in-fections were obesity (odds ratio=1.59;95% confidence interval, 1.32-1.91)and open operation as compared with a laparoscopic procedure (odds ratio=1.57;95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.97).The mean total cost was $31 933 in patients with infection vs $14 608 in patients without infection (PϽ.001).Total length of stay was longer in patients with infection than in those without infection (mean, 9.5 vs 8.1 days, respectively; PϽ.001), as was the probability of hospital readmission (27.8% vs 6.8%, respectively; P Ͻ.001).Conclusions: Obesity increases the risk of an SSI after colectomy by 60%, and the presence of infection increases the colectomy cost by a mean of $17 324.Payfor-performance policies that do not account for this increased rate of SSI and cost of caring for obese patients may lead to perverse incentives that could penalize surgeons who care for this population.",OpenAlex,0,0,12,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,infection,none,18.0

Emergent surgery is generally subject to a higher risk of SSI. Antibiotic prophylaxis is one of many measures that should be taken to prevent postoperative infection. However, due to possible adverse effects it must be applied only in indicated cases. Many guidelines have been published abroad, but still missing in Czech Republic. Standard use of prophylaxis can be currently followed due to compliance with SCIP (Surgical Care Improvement Project) measurements and reflects the quality of surgical care.The aim of our study was to evaluate the current clinical praxis of prophylactic antibiotic administration in Czech Republic in emergent surgery for diagnosis: acute appendicitis, small bowel obstruction and perforated gastroduodenal ulcer and evaluate the SCIP criteria adherence.The survey was sent to 149 surgical departments. The questionnaire included 7 questions and feedback was considered to be anonymous. The compliance with 3 main SCIP measurements (INF-1, INF-2, INF-3) was evaluated by the patients with acute appendicitis as a indication for emergent surgery.Overall, 85 (57%) completed questionnaires were received back. According to a survey results, antibiotic prophylaxis is always administered in 15% of patients operated for acute appendicitis, 27% operated for small bowel obstruction and 47% of patients with gastroduodenal perforation. No prophylaxis is given in 11 (13%) hospitals for either of the mentioned diagnoses. Antibiotics are mostly (46%) administered at induction of general anesthesia and extended to 24 hours. The SCIP measurements adherence was as follows: INF-1--4.7%; INF-2--86%; INF-3--81% of evaluated departments. All of 3 (all-or-none) criteria were fulfilled only at 3 (3.5%) surgical departments.The clinical praxis of antibiotic prophylaxis in urgent surgical procedures in Czech Republic is highly variable and mostly ignores the current international guidelines (SCIP).

Multiple patient comorbidities have been identified as SSI risk factors including obesity, tobacco use, diabetes, immunosuppression, malnutrition, and coagulopathy. However, the independent effect of multiple individual patient factors on risk of subsequent periprosthetic infection is unclear.The purposes of this study are (1) to collect data on several preestablished infection risk factors in addition to SSI-related data on a large TJA cohort; and (2) to use multivariate modeling on previously established patient risk factors to determine independent preoperative predictors of SSI.We reviewed records of patients undergoing TJA from January 1, 2010, to July 30, 2012. Confirmation of SSI followed published guidelines for superficial, deep, and periprosthetic. A total of 29 culture-positive SSIs (1.5% total) and 1846 controls were identified.

At Bugando Medical Centre there has no study documenting the epidemiology of SSI after CS despite the large number of CSs performed and the relatively common occurrence of SSIs. Methods This was a prospective cohort study involving pregnant women who underwent a CS between October 2011 and February 2012 at Bugando Medical Centre. A total of 345 pregnant women were enrolled. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Wound specimens were collected and processed as per standard operative procedures; and susceptibility testing was carried out using a disc diffusion technique. Data was analyzed using STATA version 11. Results The overall cumulative incidence of SSI was 10.9% with an incidence rate of 37.5 per 10,000 people/day (95% CI, 26.8-52.4). The median time from CS to the development of SSI was 7 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 6–9 days). Six independent risk factors for post caesarean SSI as identified in this study by multivariate analysis are: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HR: 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.6; P = 0.021), severe anaemia (HR: 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-12.4, P = 0.028), surgical wound class III (HR: 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.0; P = 0.021), multiple vaginal examinations (HR: 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.1; P = 0.011), prolonged duration of operation (HR: 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.5; P = 0.015) and an operation performed by an intern or junior doctor (HR: 4.0; 95% CI, 1.7-9.2; P = 0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism (27.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22.7%). Patients with a SSI had a longer average hospital stay than those without a SSI (12.7 ± 6.9 vs. 4 ± 1.7; P &lt; 0.0001) and the case fatality rate among patients with a SSI was 2.9%.

Although uncomplicated SSTIs are managed successfully on an outpatient basis, more serious infections extending to the subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle require complex management. Early diagnosis, selection of appropriate antimicrobials, and timely surgical intervention are key to successful treatment. Surgical-site infections, an important category of SSTI, occur in approximately half a million patients in North America annually.

We evaluate the trend of infection rates, structure and antibiotic resistance pattern. The goal of this study is to calculate the SSI rate per type of department and procedure, according with CDC-NHSN guidelines. Methods: In order to provide data on SSI in INICC surveillance system the method of data collection is based on the CDC-INICC criteria. The infection control personnel were trained in the use of CDC definitions by paper cases. We continuously collected and calculated the data from surgical site infections. Results: The rates of SSI in ISUL hospital were found to be comparable with rates reported by other countries in Europe. The total number of surgical procedures dropped from 1911 (2005) to 1713 (2010) operations per year during the study period. SSI rates in 2005 and 2006 were significantly higher (15.1% and 16.3%) compared to 13.4% (2010).Gram-negative aerobic organisms were dominant in our surgical department (ward and ICU) during the 2009 with E. coli (22.2%), K. pneumoniae (19.4%), S. aureus (12%), P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. (both 18%). The picture is dramatically different in 2010 when K. pneumoniae unexpectedly gaining force with incredible 28%, followed by S. aureus (19.7%) and E. coli -with only 16.2%. Susceptibility testing of isolates showed increasing resistance to selected antibiotics and high prevalence of ESBL producing strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae. More strains of Klebsiella spp. with additional AmpC mode of resistance were tested. A relatively high resistance in non ferments such as P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. occurs. Conclusion: Surgical site infection is not only a health but also a significant social and economic problem. We hope that our national and hospital efforts on infection control and efforts targeted at containment of resistance may bring the development of resistance to a half.

Nearly 60% of SSI diagnosis occur in the postdischarge period. However, literature provides little information on risk factors associated to in-hospital and postdischarge SSI occurrence. A national prospective multicenter study was conducted with the aim of assessing the incidence of both in-hospital and postdisharge SSI, and the associated risk factors. In 2002, a one-month, prospective national multicenter surveillance study was conducted in General and Gynecological units of 48 Italian hospitals. Case ascertainment of SSI was carried out using standardized surveillance methodology. To assess potential risk factors for SSI we used a conditional logistic regression model. We also reported the odds ratios of in-hospital and postdischarge SSI. SSI occurred in 241 (5.2%) of 4,665 patients, of which 148 (61.4%) during in-hospital, and 93 (38.6%) during postdischarge period. Of 93 postdischarge SSI, sixty-two (66.7%) and 31 (33.3%) were detected through telephone interview and questionnaire survey, respectively. Higher SSI incidence rates were observed in colon surgery (18.9%), gastric surgery (13.6%), and appendectomy (8.6%).

Southampton criteria and the centers for disease control and prevention criteria for the diagnosis of surgical site infections are used now for severity assessment. There is still controversy existing on the multifactorial causal relationship.Methods: Longitudinal Observational study with nonrandom purposive sampling carried out in the patients in OT, Casuality, ICU and Wards, in our hospital having clean contaminated abdominal operations for one-year period starting from November 2015 determine the factors responsible for surgical site infections following clean contaminated abdominal operations with prophylactic antibiotics(n=150).Results: Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio of 1.9) and emergency procedure (12.6%) were the most important risk factors for development of SSI. E. Coli (45%, n= 9) was the most common organism. Midline incision (n=6/22 = 27.27%) showed highest rate. Other high-risk factors are obesity, malnutrition, anemia, old age and prolonged duration of surgeries.Conclusions: Various host factors like malnutrition, obesity, patients knowledge about hygiene, presence of co-morbidity etc. coupled with environmental factors such as condition of the wounds, delay to initiate operation, duration of operation, prolonged exposure of peritoneal cavity to environment, prophylactic use of antibiotics and factors associated with surgery like type of incision, type of operation and experience of operating surgeon greatly contribute to occurrences of SSI. So, quality of surgical care including immediate assessment of patients, resuscitative measures, adequate preparation of patients and aseptic environment are important for control of SSI.

A Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds (FLOW) Cohort Secondary Analysis,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,2020.0,"Where Are We Now? Surgical site infections (SSIs) occurring after initial open fracture management cause substantial pain and morbidity [8]. This diagnosis also comes with diagnostic complexity and therapeutic challenges: Is the SSI superficial or deep? When should we reoperate? When do we manage with antibiotics? Missing the diagnosis or choosing the wrong treatment can result in harm to patients and a more-protracted course than what might otherwise be needed. Previous studies [2, 3, 7, 13] have shown that factors such as fracture type/severity, tobacco use, surgical time, and subcutaneous location of the bone, as well as hypothermia and other laboratory abnormalities at the time of the operation increase the risk of SSI. Generally, deep SSIs diagnosed after initial definitive open fracture are treated with thorough irrigation and débridement and subsequent antimicrobial management. Treatment options for superficial SSIs remain unclear from the literature; to my knowledge, no other large, well-designed studies exist to help differentiate and treat these patients. In the current study, Prada and colleagues [9] demonstrate that elapsed time to superficial SSI diagnosis after initial open fracture management are associated with failure to resolve infection with antibiotic treatment. In particular, superficial infections diagnosed at 90 days or later after initial treatment had a 50% chance of resolution with antibiotics versus 71% to 72% for those diagnosed sooner. Based on these findings, surgeons might consider bypassing initial antibiotic treatment in favor of early operative irrigation and debridement for late infections, in particular, those diagnosed after 3 months. Where Do We Need To Go? Reliable diagnosis and effective early treatment for SSIs is the goal, but detecting SSIs promptly remains challenging. What samples we collect, how we collect them, and how we use the findings from our diagnostic tests all form parts of a very imperfect science. Our reliance on cell culture, for example, is slow and prone both to contamination (false positives) and false-negatives. Another approach, PCR-based techniques, are prone to false-positives [11]. The known problems of cell-culture-based diagnostics provide a window of opportunity to adequately improve speed and accuracy of diagnostics. A rapid, and reliable diagnostic that provides point of care results, would allow for rapid skin biome analysis and infection diagnosis. There are promising imaging technologies, like rapid fluorescently conjugated antibodies and radiolabeling that may provide such a capability [4, 10]. While the current study adds to our knowledge [9], several questions regarding the diagnosis of superficial SSIs after initial open fracture management remain. For example, (1) are SSIs diagnosed late, after 60 or 90 days, reliably superficial? (2) Are there noninvasive means to help indicate the likelihood of deep infections lurking in the setting of apparent superficial SSIs? (3) Does anatomic region, for instance femur versus mid/distal tibia or ankle, also help predict the likelihood of coexisting deep infection at the time of superficial SSI diagnosis? (4) Are there patterns to superficial versus deep SSI pathogens and antibiotic susceptibilities found in late developing SSIs that could help guide antimicrobial management? (5) Are superficial or deep SSIs related to poor presurgical sterilization, or an opportunistic migration onto compromised skin after surgery? The last query highlights the importance of presurgical biome analysis, which informs surgeons of potential pathogenic risks prior to and after surgery [6]. Not knowing whether a superficial or deep SSI is related to how we sterilize the wound before surgery highlights the ineffectiveness of presurgical preparations against pathogens like Cutibacterium acnes, which colonize pilosebaceous glands [12]. Furthermore, more-stringent guidelines are needed for the selection of diagnostics and collection techniques [1]. Indeed, Prada and colleagues [9] found a large percentage of nonidentified pathogens in the participant pool with superficial SSI. This is important, because unless we can identify the pathogen, choosing an antibiotic type, dose, and duration may be little more than educated guesses. We need to do better. This is further complicated when patients have polymicrobial infections—a common enough situation—as improper use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may contribute to the rise of antibiotic resistance [5]. How Do We Get There? While randomized-controlled trials would provide the most-robust information, for most questions on this topic, they are impractical; prospective cohort analyses are more realistic, and I believe they can help us answer the questions I've raised. For late diagnosed superficial SSIs (either after 60 or 90 days), a group of trauma centers familiar with the treatment of open fracture sequalae could conduct a prospective, multicenter cohort analysis. Numerous tertiary and other high-volume orthopaedic trauma centers would likely be most interested, with oversight ideally by an experienced tertiary orthopaedic traumatologist. Funding could be sought through a variety of governmental and private entities including the Department of Defense, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and/or Orthopaedic Trauma Association. The proposed design would involve consecutive late-diagnosed infections (after 60 or 90 days) managed with formal irrigation and débridement, superficial and deep culture obtainment, and then antibiotic treatment. Such studies would help elucidate the percentage of patients with apparent superficial SSIs who also harbor deep infection at the time of SSI diagnosis. By comparing preoperative assessments with intraoperative findings and culture analyses, comparisons could be made to determine the reliability or current established criteria for diagnosing superficial versus deep SSI. With sufficient numbers, it might be possible to also determine if more subcutaneous anatomic regions of the body carry a higher risk of coexisting deep infection in late-diagnosed superficial SSIs. In such studies, advanced imaging such as contrast MRI or contrast CT performed prior to irrigation and débridement procedures could potentially determine characteristic findings such as the presence or absence of deep phlegmon, fluid, abscess or bony changes. We could then compare these findings with subsequent intraoperative findings and culture analyses, which may produce a more informative choice of treatment strategy. Finally, culture and sensitivity data analyzed at the time of repeat irrigation and débridement may allow smarter decisions when choosing antibiotic therapy for late occurring SSIs. Other imaging techniques like rapid fluorescently conjugated antibodies may help with diagnosis; as there is increasing familiarity with its",OpenAlex,0,0,15,2,0,2,True,False,False,False,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,antimicrobial,35.5

We sought to investigate the natural history of incision disturbances with a focus on the patient experience and resource utilization. We hypothesize that patients who have an incision disturbance consume frequent healthcare resources in the post-operative period despite the fact that most never receive a diagnosis of SSI.A 24-month prospective observational study was undertaken at an academic institution. Patients undergoing elective colorectal operation by two board-certified colorectal surgeons were followed prospectively for 90 days. Incisions were photographed serially and clinically characterized beginning as early as post-operative day two and at follow-up visits. The primary outcome was patient concern for an incision disturbance. Three surgeons reviewed clinical data and photographs to determine the presence of an incisional surgical infection, and diagnosis required agreement from two of three surgeons.There were 171 patients included; 31 (15%) sought evaluation from a healthcare provider for concerns related to their incision including 46 telephone calls, six emergency department visits, seven primary care visits, 10 home health and 40 surgical clinic visits. Incision erythema and drainage were the most common sources of patient concern. Mean body mass index was higher in patients with concern for incision disturbances (34 vs. 28 kg/m2, p < 0.0001). Ultimately, 8% (14/171) received a diagnosis of SSI by study criteria while only 2% (4/171) were captured as having an SSI by the institutional National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (p < 0.0001).Patients undergoing colorectal surgical procedures commonly are concerned with post-operative incision disturbance, yet few are associated with a diagnosis of SSI, and in-person evaluation yields frequent utilization of healthcare resources.

There is a dearth of information on risk factors for developing SSI in patients undergoing gynecologic cancer surgery, and this has not been studied using national data. Objectives The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence, preoperative and operative risk factors associated with the higher risk of SSIs in gynecologic cancer patients undergoing surgery in a tertiary care facility in a developing country. Setting Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Aga Khan University Hospitals, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. Materials and methods Retrospective record review of gynecologic oncology patients admitted for surgery from January 2015 to December 2015 was performed. Results A total of 100 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 15 were identified with SSIs, which were all found to be of the superficial type. Approximately, 44, 40, and 7% were diagnosed with endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancers respectively. The mean time from surgery to developing SSI was 12.9 days. Among endometrial cancer, 22.7% (10/44) had SSI compared with 7.5% (3/40) for ovarian cancer and 14.2% (1/7) for cervical cancer. The significant predictors of SSI were body mass index ≥35 (p-value &lt;0.004), endometrial cancer diagnosis, the American Society of Anesthesiologists class more than 3, modified surgical complexity scoring system 3 to 4, and blood sugar levels more than 180 mg/dL within 48 hours after surgery in known diabetics. Conclusion About 15% of patients undergoing laparotomy for gynecologic malignancy developed SSIs. In this study, we identified several risk factors for developing SSI among gynecologic cancer patients. These findings may contribute toward identification of patients at risk for SSIs, and the development of strategies to reduce SSI rate and potentially reduce the cost of care in gynecologic cancer surgery.

The disease and its treatment can cause significant nutritional impairments that often adversely impact patient quality of life (QOL). The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions and, in the setting of cancer, both systems may be affected. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) manifests as weight loss and steatorrhea, while endocrine insufficiency may result in diabetes mellitus. Surgical resection, a central component of pancreatic cancer treatment, may induce or exacerbate these dysfunctions. Nutritional and metabolic dysfunctions in patients with pancreatic cancer lack characterization, and few guidelines exist for nutritional support in patients after surgical resection. We reviewed publications from the past two decades (1995–2016) addressing the nutritional and metabolic status of patients with pancreatic cancer, grouping them into status at the time of diagnosis, status at the time of resection, and status of nutritional support throughout the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Here, we summarize the results of these investigations and evaluate the effectiveness of various types of nutritional support in patients after pancreatectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We outline the following conservative perioperative strategies to optimize patient outcomes and guide the care of these patients: (1) patients with albumin &lt; 2.5 mg/dL or weight loss &gt; 10% should postpone surgery and begin aggressive nutrition supplementation; (2) patients with albumin &lt; 3 mg/dL or weight loss between 5% and 10% should have nutrition supplementation prior to surgery; (3) enteral nutrition (EN) should be preferred as a nutritional intervention over total parenteral nutrition (TPN) postoperatively; and, (4) a multidisciplinary approach should be used to allow for early detection of symptoms of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency alongside implementation of appropriate treatment to improve the patient’s quality of life.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,1.0

Methods: The authors searched for randomized trials (till September 2012) comparing intraoperative high with normal Fio2 in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia and reporting on SSI, nausea or vomiting, or pulmonary outcomes. Results: The authors included 22 trials (7,001 patients) published in 26 reports. High Fio2 ranged from 80 to 100% (median, 80%); normal Fio2 ranged from 30 to 40% (median, 30%). In nine trials (5,103 patients, most received prophylactic antibiotics), the incidence of SSI decreased from 14.1% with normal Fio2 to 11.4% with high Fio2; risk ratio, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.59–1.00). After colorectal surgery, the incidence of SSI decreased from 19.3 to 15.2%; risk ratio, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.60–1.02).

In patients receiving inhalational anesthetics without prophylactic antiemetics, high Fio2 provided a significant protective effect against both nausea and vomiting. Nine trials (3,698 patients) reported on pulmonary outcomes. The risk of atelectasis was not increased with high Fio2.

Heterogeneous patient populations and differing definitions of hyperglycemia complicate broad applicability of past studies. We examined the effect of hyperglycemia on postoperative infections in patients with colorectal cancer resections. <h3>Method</h3> A retrospective review of an IRB-approved prospectively maintained database was performed for all patients with a colorectal resection and anastomosis for malignancy at a single centre from 2008–2014. All analyses, confounding variables and outcomes were proposed <i>a priori</i>. Primary outcome was evidence of a surgical site infection (SSI) defined by the Centres for Disease Control criteria and analysed as a cumulative variable of superficial, deep and organ space infections. Main independent variable was post-operative day 1 (POD1) glucose level with hyperglycemia defined <i>a priori</i>as &gt;180 mg/dL. Univariate analyses were performed using a Chi-squared test for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounding and identify the role of proposed variables on predicting the outcome of SSI. <h3>Results</h3> 349 patients underwent colorectal resections for malignancy (mean age: 65.3 (+/-13.7) years). All patients received preoperative antibiotics. 20% had a stage 3 or 4 malignancy. 26 patients had POD1 hyperglycemia (mean 128.6 mg/dL +/- 33.6) with 70 (20%) identified with a SSI.

As part of a performance improvement project, we recognized the need to differentiate infections based on severity and thus sought to characterize the most severe cases of SSI. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of women ≥18 years or older who delivered by cesarean in 2016 and 2017 at a Women's Hospital. Using a combination of ICD-10 diagnosis codes, the electronic medical record, and infection control surveillance, we identified cases and confirmed all diagnoses by chart review using CDC definitions for SSI. We defined severe SSI as cases requiring additional treatment (change in antibiotics or additional procedure), readmission, CT imaging, ICU admission, or length of stay ≥7 days. We compared maternal demographics and clinical characteristics between severe and non-severe cases using the Student t-test and Fischer exact test as appropriate. RESULTS: Among 3,507 cesarean deliveries, 141 met criteria for SSI. Of these, there were 53 cases of severe SSI. Women with severe SSI were older (31.9 vs. 30.2 years, p=0.01), had lower gestational ages at delivery (35.8 vs. 37.6 weeks, p&lt;0.01), were more likely to have diabetes (26.4% vs. 10.2%, p=0.02) and less likely to have endometritis only (50.9% vs. 81.8%, p&lt;0.01). There was no difference between groups in BMI, prior cesarean, hypertension, GBS status, length of labor or rupture of membranes, or emergent/urgent deliveries.

Traditional injectable drug therapies, while effective, have limitations such as systemic side effects, low patient compliance, and inefficient drug delivery to the wound site. Nanoparticle-infused wound dressings offer a promising alternative by providing localized, sustained drug release while enhancing the wound healing process. These advanced dressings integrate nanoparticles (NPs) such as metallic, polymeric, lipid-based, and hydrogel-based systems to improve antimicrobial activity, promote angiogenesis, and facilitate tissue regeneration. Nanoparticles enable controlled drug release, protect bioactive agents from degradation, and enhance penetration into deeper wound layers, making them highly effective for chronic wounds like diabetic ulcers, burns, and surgical incisions. Moreover, functionalized NPs can incorporate antimicrobial agents, growth factors, and anti-inflammatory compounds, significantly reducing infection risks and promoting faster healing. Emerging studies highlight the potential of silver, gold, chitosan, and lipid-based NPs in improving wound care outcomes compared to conventional approaches. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of various nanoparticle-based wound dressings, their mechanisms of action, and their advantages over injectable therapies.

This review evaluates plasma-polymerized chitosan/agarose/chitosan-agarose composite coatings as a novel approach that overcomes critical problems associated with existing antimicrobial dressings. Relative to other antimicrobial surface engineering approaches, such as silver coatings that lose efficacy or photothermal agents requiring external activation, these plasma-engineered composites utilize the natural antimicrobial properties of chitosan and the wound-healing benefits of agarose through synergistic mechanisms, namely, plasma-enhanced activation generating 3-5 times more reactive oxygen species, permanent surface charge modifications thereby providing greater bacterial repulsion, and controlled molecular anchoring enabling the sustained release of bioactive compounds for longer durations. Clinical studies have demonstrated superior performance, with enhanced biofilm reduction in diabetic ulcers compared with silver dressings, while eliminating metallic nanoparticle toxicity concerns. The plasma polymerization process uniquely embeds these biomacromolecule coatings by creating covalently bonded networks with tunable hydrophilicity and nanoscale topographies that enhance fibroblast attachment. These coatings also address the irregular drug release and stability issues of solvent-cast composites through precise spatial control at the molecular level. Owing to their faster healing rates than commercial alternatives and complete biodegradability, plasma-polymerized chitosan/agarose/chitosan-agarose composites represent significant advances in wound care, offering solutions to biofilm resistance, treatment durability, and safety challenges while enabling personalized therapeutic approaches.

In this study, we address this challenge by introducing a novel approach to fabricate antibacterial alginate-based fibrous materials using a combination of wet spinning and the wet-laying method, which offer advantages including structural and functional properties such as breathability, nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and cost-effectiveness. The wet spinning method was employed to develop porous and non-porous Ca-alginate fibers with diameters of 100 ± 4.3 nm and 132 ± 1.2 nm, respectively. Porous Ca-alginate fibers were fabricated with the utilization of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a pore-forming polymer. Obtained fibers were cut into 1-2 cm lengths to fabricate wet-laid webs. Finally, silver nanowires (AgNWs) were synthesized and then coated on the wet-laid webs at concentrations of 1 % and 3 % to impart antibacterial properties. FTIR analyses confirmed the successful removal of PVA, and swelling tests demonstrated that both porous and non-porous samples exhibit high swelling ability. The porous wet-laid materials swelled 12 times their initial weight, while this amount was 5 times their initial weight in non-porous wet-laid materials at a 60-min timepiece. SEM analysis verified fiber integrity, and MTT assays showed excellent cytocompatibility. Additionally, in vitro tests highlighted the scaffold's potential to support cell attachment and proliferation. The results demonstrate that wet-laid alginate-based fibrous dressings have low cytotoxicity, superior swelling capacity, antibacterial activity, and biocompatibility.

Silver-based treatments have long been central to burn care, but limitations have prompted the exploration of nanocrystalline silver as an alternative, with its nanoscale properties offering distinct benefits. This paper reviews the structure, properties, mechanisms of action, and clinical applications of nanocrystalline silver in burn and general wound management, with particular emphasis on how wound healing processes inform the application of these dressings. Nanocrystalline silver's high surface area-to-volume ratio and crystal structure enhance its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory efficacy. Nanocrystalline silver's mechanisms of action are disrupting cellular functions, inducing DNA damage, and inhibiting biofilms. Clinical studies demonstrate accelerated healing and reduced inflammation compared to traditional treatments. Whilst nanocrystalline silver dressings are costly, their effectiveness in lowering drug-resistant infections and minimising complications supports a financial case for their use, potentially reducing overall wound care expenses. Considerations of cytotoxicity, allergic reactions, and accessibility underscore the importance of individualised treatment selection based on wound and patient factors.

The accelerated wound healing by these metal-based nanoparticles is via the regulation of re-epithelialization and inflammation without affecting the viability of normal cells. However, there have been few reports that evaluate these wound dressings in infectious animal models to prove their efficacy. The in vivo toxicity of silver nanoparticles still needs to be addressed, revealing the need for further preclinical and clinical trials. The fabrication of wound dressings incorporated with silver nanoparticles has not been fully explored, especially for wounds requiring immediate treatment. The possible interactions between silver nanoparticles and chitosan scaffolds that result in synergistic effects still need to be understood and studied. This review provides a comprehensive report on the preclinical outcomes of chitosan wound dressing materials loaded with silver nanoparticles for managing infected wounds.",PubMed,0,0,0,13,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,antimicrobial,none,18.0

Phenotypic characterization was achieved using broth microdilution sensitivity testing, a crystal violet biofilm assay, and a wax moth pathogenesis model. Repeated exposure to ionic silver did not result in planktonic phenotypic silver resistance in any of the test panels, although S. aureus demonstrated reversible increases in minimum bactericidal concentration. An ulcer-derived P. aeruginosa exhibited marked reductions in biofilm eradication concentration as well as significantly increased biofilm formation and wax moth killing when compared to the same progenitor. These changes were reversible, trending towards baseline measurements following 10 passages on silver-free media.

This study compares once versus twice daily dressing changes with SSD, focusing on development of wound infections, incidence of hospital acquired complications, patient pain scores, and length of stay. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a once-daily or twice-daily application of SSD impacts burn wound healing outcomes. Our institution maintained a twice-daily dressing change standard of care until January 1, 2019. Patients admitted after that date had their dressing changed once daily. We performed a noninferiority analysis which indicated that a sample size of 75 per group would be sufficient to detect a significant difference with a power of 0.80. Our goal is to review outcomes for 75 patients before the change-of-practice and 75 patients after. Our main outcomes recorded are wound infection, average pain scores, average daily narcotic requirements, and length-of-stay. Results from 75 pre-change-of-practice and 75 post-change-of-practice patients showed slightly better outcomes in the post-change-of-practice group. The wound-infection rates were the same for both groups (pre = 5.33%, post = 5.33%), average daily pain levels for the pre-change group were slightly higher but the difference was negligible and not statistically significant (pre = 5.27, post = 5.25), hospital-related complication rates (unrelated to wound care) were higher pre-change (pre = 10.67%, post = 6.67%), and length-of-stay, was longer in the pre-change group (pre = 11.97, post = 10.31).

Further statistical analysis of the results, particularly in the distribution of burn type, age, and burn depth showed no discrepancy and a generalized decreased length-of-stay with once-daily SSD dressing change. Our results show that once-daily dressing changes of SSD in burn wounds have no negative impact on wound outcomes. However, it is associated with a decreased length-of-stay, decreased pain levels, and less hospital-acquired complications.

We used a porcine burn injury model to evaluate the effect of topical nanoemulsion treatment on burn wound conversion and healing. Anesthetized swine received thermal burn wounds using a 25-cm2 surface area copper bar heated to 80°C. Three different concentrations of NB-201 (10, 20, or 40% nanoemulsion), silver sulfadiazine cream, or saline were applied to burned skin immediately after injury and on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 18 postinjury. Digital images and skin biopsies were taken at each dressing change. Skin biopsy samples were stained for histological evaluation and graded. Skin tissue samples were also assayed for mediators of inflammation. Dermal treatment with NB-201 diminished thermal burn wound conversion to a full-thickness injury as determined by both histological and visual evaluation.

This may be due to variation in the type and depth of wounds in clinical studies. The aim of this study was to use a standardized porcine wound model to compare three dressings commonly used in burn centers for partial-thickness burns. Partial-thickness scalds were made on the flanks of pigs. Wounds were treated with silver sulfadiazine (SSD, flammazine), a hydrofiber dressing, or glycerol-preserved allogeneic (pig) skin. The healing process was monitored for 8 weeks. Macroscopic parameters were the itching behavior, the cosmetic appearance of the scars, and contraction. Microscopic parameters were the inflammatory response, myofibroblast influx, and the numbers of nerves. All wounds were closed on day 14 and wound infection did not occur. Treatment with SSD resulted in significantly more wound contraction compared to treatment with glycerol-preserved pig skin. Animals treated with SSD suffered more from itching (scratching) during the first 2 weeks after wounding. The number of nerves in healing wounds of these animals was significantly higher compared to wounds treated with hydrofiber dressing or allogeneic skin. In our standardized porcine partial-thickness wound model, treatment with SSD resulted in less favorable wound healing.

Materials in medicine,2020.0,"All chronic wounds are colonised by bacteria; for some, colonisation progresses to become infection. Alginate wound dressings are used for highly exuding chronic wounds as they are very absorbent, taking up large quantities of exudate while maintaining a moist wound bed to support healing. Some alginate dressings are doped with antimicrobials, most commonly silver, but evidence regarding the efficacy of these is largely inconclusive. This manuscript describes the development and in vitro assessment of alginate materials doped with chlorhexidine hexametaphosphate (CHX-HMP), a sparingly soluble salt which when exposed to aqueous environments provides sustained release of the common antiseptic chlorhexidine. Comparator materials were a commercial silver alginate dressing material and an alginate doped with chlorhexidine digluconate (CHXdg). CHX-HMP alginates provided a dose-dependent CHX release which was sustained for over 14 days, whereas CHXdg alginates released limited CHX and this ceased within 24 h. CHX-HMP and silver alginates were efficacious against 5 major wound pathogens (MRSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii) in a total viable count (TVC) and an agar diffusion zone of inhibition (ZOI) model. At baseline the silver alginate was more effective than the CHX-HMP alginate in the TVC assay but the CHX-HMP alginate was the more effective in the ZOI assay.

Incomplete debridement at the level of the basement membrane is the postulated cause. Graham pioneered laser debridement of mustard burns. For field or mass-casualty use, saline wet-to-wet or antibiotic-soak debridement is more practical. In this study, we compared laser, saline, and antibiotic debridement in a porcine model of deep partial-thickness injury. Deep-dermal sulfur mustard burns were produced in 18 anesthetized Gottingen minipigs using 10-μl saturated vapor cap exposure time of 90 minutes. Debridement was started 48 hours postinjury and consisted of a single laser treatment; 5 days of 5% aqueous mafenide acetate wet-to-wet dressings; or 7 to 12 days of saline wet-to-wet dressings. Wounds were treated with daily silver sulfadiazine for 30 days and, then, assessed by histopathology, silver-ion analysis, colorimetry, and evaporimetry. All wounds healed well with no sign of infection. Antibiotic debridement showed no advantage over saline debridement. There were no significant differences between groups for colorimetry or evaporimetry. Histopathology was graded on a mustard-specific scale of 1 to 15 where higher values indicate better healing. Mean histology scores were 13.6 for laser, 13.9 for mafenide, and 14.3 for saline. Saline debridement statistically outperformed laser (P < .05) but required the longest debridement time.

,,"Development, characterisation and evaluation of a simple polymicrobial colony biofilm model for testing of antimicrobial wound dressings.",Journal of applied microbiology,2024.0,"AIMS
Simple biofilm models are the first step to testing of any antimicrobial and wound dressing, therefore the aim of this study was to develop and validate a simple polymicrobial colony biofilm wound model comprised of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans on RPMI-1640 agar. The model was then used to evaluate the topical disinfectant chlorohexidine and four commercially available wound dressings using the polymicrobial model. The model used was as a starting point to mimic debridement in clinical care of wounds and the effectiveness of wound dressings evaluated afterwards.


METHODS & RESULTS
Planktonic assessment using AATCC100-2004 demonstrated that all antimicrobial wound dressings reduced the planktonic microbial burden below the limit of detection, however, when challenged with polymicrobial colony biofilms, silver wound dressings showed limited effectiveness (1-2 Log CFU reductions). In contrast a single iodine releasing wound dressing showed potent antibiofilm activity reducing all species CFUs below the limit of detection (>6 log-10 log) depending on the species. A disrupted biofilm model challenge was performed to represent the debridement of a wound and wound silver based wound dressings were found to be marginally more effective than in whole colony biofilm challenges while the iodine containing wound dressing reduced microbial recovery below the limit of detection.


CONCLUSIONS
In this model silver dressings were ineffective versus the whole colony biofilms but showed some recovery of activity versus the disrupted colony biofilm. The iodine wound dressing reduced the viability of all species below the level of detection. This suggests that mode of action of wound dressing should be considered for the type of biofilm challenge as should the clinical use e.g. debridement.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,2,6,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,infection,11.0
,,Development of next-generation antimicrobial hydrogel dressing to combat burn wound infection,Bioscience Reports,2021.0,"Abstract Infection of burn wounds often leads to poor healing, sepsis, disability, or even death. Traditional care focuses on early debridement, fluid resuscitation, and intravenous antibiotics but these are often inadequate due to compromised vasculature limiting systemic antibiotics effectiveness. Biofilms in burn wounds are barriers to treatment and are associated with the transition of wounds from acute to chronic non-healing state. Current topical treatments for burn wounds include skin substitutes impregnated with skin or stem cells that promote healing; or hydrogels delivering an antibiotic, silver, or synthetic antimicrobial peptides. The success of currently available products is varied and, in some cases, very limited due to associated cytotoxicity to mammalian cells, the ability to only fight extracellular biofilm infections, and the ever-increasing development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). There is, therefore, a high clinical need for the development of next-generation hydrogel wound dressings, to combat bacterial burn wound infection. A recent paper by Khan et al.

Silver sulfadiazine dressing, renowned for its antimicrobial and wound-healing properties, is emerging as a potential adjunctive therapy for omphalocele. Aim of the study: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of silver sulfadiazine dressing in the non-operative management of omphalocele. Methods: This prospective interventional study was carried out at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), Dhaka, Bangladesh, from March 2018 to June 2020. The study included 10 neonates with omphalocele who received silver sulfadiazine dressing. Random sampling was employed for participant selection, and data were collected using a pre-designed data collection sheet. Analysis and presentation of data were done using the MS Office suite. Results: The average age of the participants was 1.0±1.15 years, and 60% of them were male.

Hydrogels with silver nanoparticles can present many advantages for this field. However, if the aggregation and sterilization of this product have not been carefully considered, the effectiveness or use could be limited. Therefore, in the current study, a hydrogel-based wound dressing membrane was developed using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG), agar, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Silver ions (Ag+) were dispersed in the polymer matrix and its reduction with formation of a hydrogel and silver nanoparticles was performed using 60Co gamma irradiation to enhance the dressings antimicrobial properties. The resulting hydrogel presented a high degree of swelling and a good size control of silver nanoparticles. The incorporation of AgNPs was confirmed via Raman spectroscopy and the samples presented no signs of toxicity in vitro as assessed using an elution assay with neutral red uptake as the cytotoxic end point. Membranes were tested in vivo using a full thickness defeat model in rabbits. Postmortem histopathological analysis indicated that the use of the hydrogel membranes that incorporated AgNPs had a stimulatory action on wound healing as evidenced by a high intensity of fibroblasts and neovascularization in the tissue, which promoted a faster healing process when compared to the untreated wounds. We demonstrate the possibility of producing a hydrogel with good size control of AgNPs, which can also be directly sterilized within the formation of this material via gamma irradiation.

,,Comparative Effectiveness of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy With and Without Oxidized Regenerated Cellulose (ORC)/Collagen/Silver-ORC Dressing.,Advances in wound care,2024.0,"OBJECTIVE
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC)/collagen/silver-ORC (OCSO) dressings have individually demonstrated effectiveness in supporting wound healing, but few studies have examined their combined use. This retrospective data analysis compared wound outcomes following outpatient NPWT with and without OCSO dressings.


APPROACH
A search of de-identified records from the U.S. Wound Registry resulted in 485 cases of wounds managed with NPWT with OCSO dressings. A matched cohort of patients who received NPWT without any collagen dressing (n=485) was created using propensity scoring. For patients in the NPWT+OCSO group, OCSO was applied topically on or after the day of NPWT initiation and stopped on or before the day of NPWT termination.


RESULTS
Wounds managed with NPWT+OCSO were significantly more likely to improve and/or heal compared to wounds that received NPWT alone (p=0.00029). The relative wound area reduction was 40% for patients receiving NPWT+OCSO, compared to 9% for patients receiving only NPWT (p=0.0099). The median time to achieve 75-100% granulation coverage with no measurable wound depth was shorter by 8 days with NPWT+OCSO in all wound types (p=0.00034), and by 14 days in surgical wounds (p=0.0010), than with NPWT alone.


INNOVATION
This is the first study examining the clinical outcomes associated with the integration of NPWT and OCSO dressings compared to the use of NPWT alone. These data support the novel practice of applying NPWT concurrently with OCSO dressings.

To investigate the role of an adherent soft silicone antimicrobial occlusive foam silver-impregnated dressing for reduction of surgical site infections (SSI) in primary low-transverse caesarean section (1°LTCS) delivery.


METHOD
Women aged 18-45 years admitted to the labour and delivery or the antepartum unit undergoing a 1°LTCS were recruited. Exclusion criteria included repeat caesarean, vertical skin incision, intrapartum fever and closure with staples. Consented participants delivered by scheduled or unscheduled 1°LTCS received the silver-impregnated dressing. Those who declined to participate and were delivered by scheduled or unscheduled caesarean received a standard gauze with tape dressing (controls). Surgical preparation and preoperative antibiotics were administered as per hospital policy.


RESULTS
A total of 362 participants were consented for use of the silver-impregnated dressing, with 190 participants undergoing 1°LTCS, of whom 185 were included in the final analysis. Of those who declined to participate, 190 ultimately underwent 1°LTCS during the same time period. Cases and controls were similar in demographics, body mass index, diabetes status, labour and procedure length, and tobacco use. The overall incidence of SSI was 3.7%.

,,A multimodel regime for evaluating effectiveness of antimicrobial wound care products in microbial biofilms,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2020.0,"Microbial biofilms have become increasingly recognized as a cause of wound chronicity. There are several topical antimicrobial wound care products available for use; however, their effectiveness has routinely been demonstrated with planktonic microorganisms. There is no target reference value for antimicrobial effectiveness of wound care products in biofilm models. In addition, data on antimicrobial activity of products in biofilm models are scattered across many test methods in a variety of studies. The aim of this work is to directly compare commercial products containing the commonly used topical antimicrobial agents iodine, silver, polyhexamethylene biguanide, octenidine, hypochlorous acid, benzalkonium chloride, and a surfactant‐based topical containing poloxamer 188. Five different in vitro biofilm models of varied complexity were used, incorporating several bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. The fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Candida auris were also evaluated. A multispecies bacterial biofilm model was also used to evaluate the products. Additionally, C. albicans was used in combination with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in a multikingdom version of the polymicrobial biofilm model. Statistically significant differences in antimicrobial performance were observed between treatments in each model and changing microbial growth conditions or combinations of organisms resulted in significant performance differences for some treatments. The iodine and benzalkonium chloride‐containing products were overall the most effective in vitro and were then selected for in vivo evaluation in an infected immunocompromised murine model. Unexpectedly, the iodine product was statistically (P > .05) no different than the untreated control, while the benzalkonium chloride containing product significantly (P < .05) reduced the biofilm compared to untreated control.

A frequent complication is diabetic ulcer, which is a condition of partial or complete tissue deformity. If it does not get proper treatment, it is very risky to get an infection that leads to amputation.Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has become a prevalent disease, imposing a significant burden on public health due to its widespread occurrence and association with numerous disabilities and fatalities. Uncontrolled DM can lead to severe metabolic complications and long-term vascular issues, including microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. Additionally, individuals with DM are highly susceptible to foot infections, which can escalate into gangrene if not properly managed. 
Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of modern dressing in the wound care process on diabetic wound healing. 
Methods: Data collection used descriptive analysis and literature study. The databases used were PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest and Web of Science. Journal inclusion criteria used PICO and article analysis was conducted by 6 authors. 
Findings: The evaluated article's findings elucidate the patient's degree of comfort and the more important healing process. It has been demonstrated that contemporary wound care applications make patients feel more at ease as their wounds heal, greatly aiding nurses in nursing care. Modern wound care is a practice that will evolve in response to advancements in nursing science; in this instance, it centers on how comfortable patients are while obtaining wound care-related medical treatments. Therefore, nurses must advance the knowledge behind the use of contemporary wound care to promote patient comfort and hasten the healing process.

We conducted a comparative prospective study on 80 patients admitted to the Plastic Surgery Department of “Prof. Dr. Agrippa Ionescu” Emergency Clinical Hospital between 1st of January 2020 and 31st of December 2022. The study population was randomized to receive either silver nanoparticle dressings or negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) combined with silver nanoparticle dressings. Various parameters were monitored, including patient comorbidities and graft-related data such as defect etiology, graft integration, and graft size. Dressings were changed, and graft status was evaluated at 7, 10, and 14 days postoperatively. Additionally, baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured before surgery and 7, 10, and 14 days postoperatively. Results: The study demonstrated an enhanced integration of skin grafts at all evaluation stages when employing NPWT combined with AgNPs, particularly evident 10 days post operation. Significant variations in graft integration were also observed based on factors such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, graft size, or the origin of the grafted defect. Moreover, dynamic C-reactive protein monitoring showed a statistically significant decrease in CRP levels 10 days post operation among patients treated with NPWT in conjunction with silver dressing, consistent with the nearly complete integration of skin grafts at this evaluation threshold. Conclusion: Several factors influence the postoperative evolution of split-skin grafts. Postoperative dressings target local factors to enhance graft integration further. Our research demonstrated that the innovative combination of NPWT-assisted dressings, complemented by a silver nanoparticle sheet, resulted in improved benefits for graft integration and the alleviation of systemic inflammation.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,11,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,antimicrobial,none,16.0

The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains has sparked a growing interest in naturally occurring bioactive substances, like curcumin, that possess wound-healing capabilities. Silver is a natural antimicrobial agent, and finds extensive use in specialized wound dressings. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using an eco-friendly approach, employing curcumin. The prepared nanoparticles have been characterized using TEM, DLS, and zeta potential. The prepared AgNPs were loaded on sodium alginate-co-gum arabic hydrogel. Two hydrogel samples (with and without AgNPs) have been applied for wound healing. The developed silver nanoparticles that were created exhibited effective action against both types of bacteria, namely Gram-negative and Gram-positive. Alg-co-AG-AgNPs demonstrated faster wound healing rates compared to using the control hydrogel sample.

,,Antimicrobial silver dressings: a review of emerging issues for modern wound care,ANZ Journal of Surgery,2021.0,"Skin is an important barrier to pathogenic microorganisms and plays a critical role in a ctivation of innate immune responses. When the skin barrier is breached following wounding or burn injury, pathogens can invade and complicate healing with infection resulting in delayed healing and symptomatic scarring. Wound infection is a significant problem after burn injury and in patients with chronic wounds. Antimicrobial silver has had a significant role in wound antisepsis throughout history and, given the rise in community acquired antibiotic resistance, silver dressings are now commonly used to combat wound infection. The multi‐modal mechanism of action, low potential for toxicity and formation of microbial resistance makes silver dressings suitable tools against a wide array of clinically important microbes. There are, however, a number of issues with silver dressings including a conflicting evidence base, the important environmental consideration of nanoparticle manufacture, and the significant cost of these products. One solution may be to adopt an ‘opened‐but‐unused’ means of wound care whereby bulk dressing materials are used piecemeal and stored in between dressing changes to increase the cost‐effectiveness and reduced wastage.

,,In vitro and in vivo evaluation of the antimicrobial effectiveness of non‐medicated hydrophobic wound dressings,International Wound Journal,2023.0,"There is an increasing use of non‐medicated wound dressing with claims of irreversible bacterial binding. Most of the data are from in vitro models which lack clinical relevance. This study employed a range of in vitro experiments to address this gap and we complemented our experimental designs with in vivo observations using dressings obtained from patients with diabetes‐related foot ulcers. A hydrophobic wound dressing was compared with a control silicone dressing in vitro. Test dressings were placed on top of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa challenge suspension with increasing concentrations of suspension inoculum in addition to supplementation with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or increased protein content (IPC). Next, we used the challenge suspensions obtained at the end of the first experiment, where bacterial loads from the suspensions were enumerated following test dressing exposure. Further, the time‐dependent bacterial attachment was investigated over 1 and 24 h. Lastly, test dressings were exposed to a challenge suspension with IPC, with or without the addition of the bacteriostatic agent Deferiprone to assess the impacts of limiting bacterial growth in the experimental design. Lastly, two different wound dressings with claims of bacterial binding were obtained from patients with chronic diabetes‐related foot ulcers after 72 h of application and observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Bacteria were enumerated from each dressing after a 1‐h exposure time. There was no statistical difference in bacterial attachment between both test dressings when using different suspension inoculum concentrations or test mediums. Bacterial attachment to the two test dressings was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) when IPC was used instead of PBS. In the challenge suspension with PBS, only the hydrophobic dressing achieved a statistically significant reduction in bacterial loads (0.5 ± 0.05 log colony forming units; p = 0.001). In the presence of IPC, there was no significant reduction in bacterial loads for either test dressing. When bacterial growth was arrested, attachment to the test dressings did not increase over time, suggesting that the number of bacteria on the test dressings increases over time due to bacterial growth. SEM identified widespread adsorption of host fouling across the test dressings which occurred prior to microbial binding. Therein, microbial attachment occurred predominantly to host fouling and not directly to the dressings. Bacterial binding is not unique to dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC) dressings and under clinically relevant in vitro conditions and in vivo observations, we demonstrate (in addition to previously published work) that the bacterial binding capabilities are not effective at reducing the number of bacteria in laboratory models or human wounds.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,2,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,antimicrobial,8.0

Because wounds often encounter opportunistic microbes that can delay healing, the effectiveness of these materials is often suboptimal, resulting in delayed or compromised wound healing. The importance of reducing and controlling wound microbes is well recognised and there are several antimicrobial options available to address this unmet clinical need. This study compares the antimicrobial and wound healing capabilities, both in vivo and in vitro against methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) USA 300, for the following compounds: Collagen Wound Matrix‐Anti Microbial (CWM‐AM); Collagen Wound Matrix‐Anti Microbial XT (CWM‐AM XT); Antimicrobial Hydrofiber Wound Dressing (AHWD); Dermal Scaffold with Silver (DRSAg); Collagen Extracellular Matrix (CEM); Collagen Wound Matrix (CWM); Matrix Wound Dressing with Silver (MWDAg); Cadexomer Iodine Gel (CIG); Triple Antibiotic Ointment (TAO); and Antimicrobial Wound Gel (AWG).

Furthermore, CWM‐AM, CWM‐AM XT, AWG, and CIG exhibited a persistent antimicrobial activity for up to 10 days after incubation. However, in the cytotoxicity studies performed using human fibroblasts, CWM‐AM and CWM‐AM XT had no detrimental effects in cell proliferation and viability, while AWG and CIG were cytotoxic and prohibitive for cell proliferation. Treatments were then assessed for microbiology and wound healing efficacy using an in vivo porcine deep reticular dermal wound model.

This study was conducted to provide comparative data on the clinical efficacy and safety of a novel hard-to-heal wound dressing (Sorelex; Contipro a.s., Czech Republic) that combines octenidine and hyaluronan, compared with a silver-based dressing.


METHOD
This multicentre, open-label, randomised, post-market, clinical follow-up study provides a comparison of a octenidine and hyaluronan combination with a standard-of-care (SoC) silver-containing dressing. The investigators evaluated the management of infection in the hard-to-heal wounds based on recorded changes in the appearance of the wound bed tissue and the presence of clinical signs of infection after three weeks of treatment. Other relevant assessed parameters of wound healing were: wound size; exudation level; wound pain level; and surrounding skin appearance.


RESULTS
The study cohort included 48 patients in the Sorelex arm and 39 patients in the SoC arm. Both products evinced numerous parameters of wound infection management: reductions in the wound bed slough; marked decreases in wound size; the formation of re-epithelialisation and granulation tissue; and improved pain management. Sorelex significantly improved the condition of surrounding skin after three weeks of treatment, unlike SoC. Sorelex reduced wound area significantly more than SoC (p=0.04). No statistically significant differences were detected in other assessed parameters between the two study arms. All the participating investigators expressed their satisfaction with both products. No adverse reactions to Sorelex were recorded over the mean treatment period of 53 days.

,,Wound Dressing Modifications for Accelerated Healing of Infected Wounds,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2023.0,"Infections that occur during wound healing involve the most frequent complications in the field of wound care which not only inhibit the whole process but also lead to non-healing wound formation. The diversity of the skin microbiota and the wound microenvironment can favor the occurrence of skin infections, contributing to an increased level of morbidity and even mortality. As a consequence, immediate effective treatment is required to prevent such pathological conditions. Antimicrobial agents loaded into wound dressings have turned out to be a great option to reduce wound colonization and improve the healing process. In this review paper, the influence of bacterial infections on the wound-healing phases and promising modifications of dressing materials for accelerated healing of infected wounds are discussed.

,,A standardized wound infection model for antimicrobial testing of wound dressings in vitro,International Wound Journal,2024.0,"To investigate the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents against wound infections, experiments using either 2D cultures with planktonic microorganisms or animal infection models are frequently carried out. However, the transferability of the results to human skin is limited by the lack of complexity of the 2D models or by the poor translation of the results from animal models. Hence, there is a need for wound infection models capable of assessing antimicrobial agents. In this study, an easily standardized wound infection model was established. This model consists of a mechanically wounded human skin model on a collagen matrix infected with various clinically relevant bacteria. Infection of the model led to recognition of the pathogens and induction of an inflammatory response. The untreated infection spread over time, causing significant tissue damage. By applying an antimicrobial‐releasing wound dressing, the bacterial load could be reduced and the success of the treatment could be further measured by a decrease in the inflammatory reaction.

,,Quality of Care and Cost-effectiveness: Optimizing Wound Care in the Netherlands,Advances in Skin & Wound Care,2022.0,"ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE Previously, the authors implemented a “fast-track protocol” in the Netherlands to shorten the time to referral for patients when diagnostic testing was deemed necessary given suspicion of underlying pathology preventing wound healing. This subanalysis of the cross-sectional study presents the cost reduction of using that fast-track protocol. METHODS The cross-sectional study data were collected at the Alrijne Wound Centre between January 2017 and January 2018 and included patients from two general practitioner practices and a large home-care organization who had a new occurrence of wounds. The cost-effectiveness analysis consisted of an analysis of the mean reduction in care, wound dressing materials, and reduction in unnecessary hospital referrals. RESULTS In 2017, a total of 415 patients received wound care of the general practitioners or home-care organization. By using the “fast-track” protocol, costs were reduced in all areas. After extrapolation, the minimum mean cost reduction in wound care was €129,949,638; on wound dressings, it was €2,623,920, and on the reduction of unnecessary hospital referrals, the average recovery was €2,436,000. CONCLUSIONS Prompt triage, analyses, and treatment of underlying causes by specialized doctors in a multidisciplinary setting offer enormous potential for cost savings. The conservative estimate is that approximately €135,000,000 to €293,000,000 can be saved in annual healthcare costs in the Netherlands using this protocol.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,,,,,C,Low,,general,none,2.0
,,Clinically relevant evaluation of the antimicrobial and anti‐inflammatory properties of nanocrystalline and nanomolecular silver,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2024.0,"Burns and chronic wounds present significant challenges in wound management due to risks of infection, excessive inflammation, and prolonged healing. Silver‐based treatments have long been central to burn care, but limitations have prompted the exploration of nanocrystalline silver as an alternative, with its nanoscale properties offering distinct benefits. This paper reviews the structure, properties, mechanisms of action, and clinical applications of nanocrystalline silver in burn and general wound management, with particular emphasis on how wound healing processes inform the application of these dressings. Nanocrystalline silver's high surface area‐to‐volume ratio and crystal structure enhance its antimicrobial and anti‐inflammatory efficacy. Nanocrystalline silver's mechanisms of action are disrupting cellular functions, inducing DNA damage, and inhibiting biofilms. Clinical studies demonstrate accelerated healing and reduced inflammation compared to traditional treatments. Whilst nanocrystalline silver dressings are costly, their effectiveness in lowering drug‐resistant infections and minimising complications supports a financial case for their use, potentially reducing overall wound care expenses. Considerations of cytotoxicity, allergic reactions, and accessibility underscore the importance of individualised treatment selection based on wound and patient factors. In conclusion, nanocrystalline silver holds substantial promise in burn wound management, and further research is warranted to optimise its therapeutic potential and economic benefits in clinical practice.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,1,10,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,infection,13.5

METHOD
A multicentre randomised controlled open-label wound-dressing trial was conducted in two wound care outpatient clinics in western Switzerland from November 2018 to March 2020.


RESULTS
A total of 77 successive patients were randomised to receive either a sterile polyacrylate wound pad with activated carbon cloth treatment (n=38) or the standard non-adhesive hydrocellular foam dressing with silver (n=39). Reduction in wound area was the primary outcome, whereas the application period of the dressing, odour, maceration and pain were the secondary outcomes. Wound area was measured at baseline and during each wound dressing change until the dressings were no longer indicated. Wound area reduced faster in the intervention group than in the control group (0.45cm2 per day vs. 0.2cm2 per day), although the application period was longer in the intervention group compared with the control group (9.5 days vs. 8.1 days). Maceration reduction was more pronounced in the intervention group (-2.07cm2) than in the control group (-0.71cm2). Odour, pain and infection were similar in both groups.

,,Cost-effectiveness of superabsorbent wound dressing versus standard of care in patients with moderate-to-highly exuding leg ulcers.,Journal of wound care,2020.0,"OBJECTIVE
To determine the cost-effectiveness/utility of a superabsorbent wound dressing (Zetuvit Plus Silicone) versus the current standard of care (SoC) dressings, from the NHS perspective in England, in patients with moderate-to-high exudating leg ulcers.


METHOD
A model-based economic evaluation was conducted to analyse the cost-effectiveness/utility of a new intervention. We used a microsimulation state-transition model with a time horizon of six months and a cycle length of one week. The model uses a combination of incidence base and risk prediction approach to inform transition probabilities. All clinical efficiency, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cost and resource use inputs were informed by conducting a systematic review of UK specific literature.


RESULTS
Treatment with the superabsorbent dressing leads to a total expected cost per patient for a six month period of £2887, associated with 15.933 expected quality adjusted life weeks and 10.9% healing rate. When treated with SoC, the total expected cost per patient for a six month period is £3109, 15.852 expected quality adjusted life weeks and 8% healing rate. Therefore, the superabsorbent dressing leads to an increase in quality-adjusted life weeks, an increase in healing rate by 2.9% and a cost-saving of £222 per single average patient over six months. Results of several scenario analyses, one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of base-case results. The probabilistic analysis confirmed that, in any combination of variable values, the superabsorbent dressing leads to cost saving results.

Silver dressings have been used in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). However, meta-analyses examining their effectiveness is lacking. Therefore, this meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of silver dressings on DFU healing.


METHOD
Various databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of silver dressing applied to DFUs.


RESULTS
A total of seven studies involving 650 patients were identified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The odds ratio (OR) for silver dressing improving wound healing rate, complete healing time, ulcer-related in-hospital time and infection resolution rate were: 4.02 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.25-7.17; p<0.01); 2.81 (95% CI: -3.33--2.29; p<0.01); 12.13 (95% CI:-20.64--3.62; p<0.01); and 7.36 (95% CI: 1.58-34.22; p=0.01), respectively. The OR on ulcer area reduction was 8.60 (95% CI:-8.93-26.12; p=0.34) indicating no significant effect.


CONCLUSION
The results of this meta-analysis showed that silver dressings enhance DFU healing rate, shorten the time to complete healing, shorten in-hospital duration, and improve infection resolution rate, while having no significant effect on reduction of ulcer area. Large-scale, multicentre, rigorously designed RCTs are recommended for future investigation to justify the beneficial effects of silver dressings on DFU healing.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,2,9,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,antimicrobial,infection,24.0
,,A wound-friendly antibacterial hyaluronic acid dressing with on-demand removability for infected wound healing,Biomaterials Research,2023.0,"Background Antibacterial activity and on-demand removability are key characteristics governing the effectiveness of clinic wound dressing. However, the excellent tissue adhesion of new dressings is often overemphasized without a detailed discussion of dressing replacement. Besides, the inherent antibacterial ability of dressings is beneficial for promoting the healing of infected wound. Therefore, we rationally design an injectable antibacterial wound dressing with on-demand removability to accelerate infected wound healing. Method We design this wound dressing with a simple and feasible method based on the electrostatic self-assembly of hyaluronic acid and ε-polylysine. We investigated the efficacy of this dressing in terms of its microtopography, rheology, self-healing performance, adhesive ability, antimicrobial, hemostatic, on-demand removal properties, and wound healing promotion through various tests. Results The prepared dressing possesses injectability, self-healing ability and antibacterial activity, showing NaCl-triggered on-demand dissolution due to the disruption of electrostatic interactions.

,,"The heterogeneous wound microbiome varies with wound care pain, dressing type, and inflammatory gene expression",Wound Repair and Regeneration,2024.0,"Wound dressing changes are essential procedures for wound management. However, ~50% of patients experience severe pain during these procedures despite the availability of analgesic medications, indicating a need for novel therapeutics that address underlying causes of pain. Along with other clinical factors, wound pathogens and inflammatory immune responses have previously been implicated in wound pain. To test whether these factors could contribute to severe pain during wound dressing changes, we conducted an exploratory, cross‐sectional analysis of patient‐reported pain, inflammatory immune responses, and wound microbiome composition in 445 wounds at the time of a study dressing change. We profiled the bacterial composition of 406 wounds using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing and quantified gene expression of 13 inflammatory markers in wound fluid using quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Neither inflammatory gene expression nor clinically observed inflammation were associated with severe pain, but Corynebacterium and Streptococcus were of lower relative abundance in wounds of patients reporting severe pain than those reporting little or no pain. Wound microbiome composition differed by wound location, and correlated with six of the inflammatory markers, including complement receptor C5AR1, pro‐inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)1β, chemokine IL‐8, matrix metalloproteinase MMP2, and the antimicrobial peptide encoding cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide. Interestingly, we found a relationship between the wound microbiome and vacuum‐assisted wound closure (VAC).

,,608 Timing of Nanocrystalline Silver-based Dressing Application – a Retrospective Single-center Pediatric Cohort Study,Journal of Burn Care & Research: Official Publication of the American Burn Association,2023.0,"Abstract Introduction Nanocrystalline silver-based dressings (NSBD) are commonly used at different stages of the treatment of burn wounds. They have been shown to reduce the incidence of surgical procedures, time to re-epithelialization in partial thickness burn injuries, and decrease pain with dressing changes compared to silver sulfadiazine in adult and pediatric populations. Recent evidence has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in addition to the known antimicrobial properties. We hypothesized that the timing of nanocrystalline silver-based dressings application ( < 24h after burn injury) may impact surgical treatment rates. Methods This study was a retrospective single-center cohort study. All pediatric patients ( < 18 years old) treated at a single academic pediatric center for acute partial thickness burn injuries, between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 were included. Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to compare timing of nanocrystalline silver application and surgical treatment rates. Results Four hundred seventy-six patients were included for analysis. One hundred four (21.85%) had NSBD and 372 (78.11%) had non-silver non-adherent dressings applied within the first 24 hours post injury. No statistically significant difference was found in surgical treatment, age, sex, mechanism, anatomic location, or total body surface area (TBSA) on bivariate analysis. The multivariable logistic regression identified three statistically significant variables as predictors for surgical treatment: age (OR = 1.14, 95% CI [1.06-1.23]), TBSA (OR = 1.15, 95% CI [1.06-1.25]), and burns to buttocks/lower extremity burns (excluding feet) (OR = 2.39, 95% CI [1.26-4.53]). Immediate ( < 24h) application of NSBD has not been demonstrated to decrease the likelihood of surgical treatment. Conclusions Immediate ( < 24h) application of nanocrystalline silver-based dressings does not affect surgical treatment rates. Prospective randomized studies are required to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory benefits of early nanocrystalline silver-based dressings in the treatment of pediatric burn injuries.

AgNO3 (10, 20, and 30 mmol) solutions were mixed with LSH suspension in deionized water and exposed to diffused sunlight. Reaction was monitored by noting the change in the color of reaction mixture up to 10 h. Ag NPs showed characteristic ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) absorptions from 410 to 437 nm in the case of sunlight and 397–410 nm in the case of temperature study. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed the formation of spherical Ag NPs in the range of 10–35 nm. Face-centered cubic array of Ag NPs was confirmed by characteristic diffraction peaks in powder X-ray diffraction spectrum. Ag NPs were stored in LSH thin films, and UV/Vis spectra recorded after 6 months indicated that Ag NPs retained their texture over the storage period. Significant antimicrobial activity was observed when microbial cultures (bacteria and fungi) were exposed to the synthesized Ag NPs.

,,Antimicrobial Nonisocyanate Polyurethane Foam Derived from Lignin for Wound Healing.,ACS applied bio materials,2024.0,"Medical dressings, as a cover for wounds, can replace damaged skin in the wound healing process to play a temporary barrier role, avoid or control wound infection, and provide a favorable environment for wound healing. Therefore, there is an urgent need for medical antimicrobial dressings for the treatment of chronic wounds. Although traditional polyurethane foam has been widely used in medical dressings, conventional polyurethane foams are primarily prepared using nonbiocompatible isocyanate-based compounds, which are potentially hazardous for both operators and applications in the medical field. Here, we propose nonisocyanate polyurethane foams naturally derived from lignin by enzymatic lignin alkylation, cyclic carbonation modification, and polymerization with diamine and the addition of a blowing agent. Silver nanoparticle solution was added during foaming to confer antimicrobial properties. This lignin-based nonisocyanate polyurethane/silver composite foam (named NIPU foam-silver) using a green synthesis method has good mechanical properties, which can be used to manufacture polyurethane/silver foams, and thermal and antimicrobial properties. Notably, NIPU foam-Ag showed more than 95% bactericidal efficacy against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus within 4 h.

Interactions of antimicrobial dressings with bacterial load, biofilm matrix and the overall protein-rich wound microenvironment remain insufficiently studied. This analysis aimed to extend the investigation on the efficacy of a variety of antimicrobial dressings using an in vitro biofilm model (lhBIOM) mimicking the specific biofilm-environment in human wounds. Four wound dressings containing polyhexanide (PHMB), octendine di-hydrochloride (OCT), cadexomer-iodine (C-IOD) or ionic silver (AG) were compared regarding their antimicrobial efficacy. Quantitative analysis was performed using a quantitative suspension method, separately assessing remaining microbial counts within the solid biofilm as well as the dressing eluate (representing the absorbed wound exudate). Dressing performance was tested against P. aeruginosa biofilms over the course of 6 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to obtain qualitative visualization on changes in biofilm structure. C-IOD demonstrated superior bacterial reduction. In comparison it was the only dressing achieving a significant reduction of more than 7 log10 steps within 3 days. Neither the OCT- nor the AG-containing dressing exerted a distinct and sustained antimicrobial effect. PHMB achieved a non-significant microbicidal effect (1.71 ± 0.31 log10 steps) at day 1. Over the remaining course (6 days) it demonstrated a significant microbistatic effect compared to OCT, AG and the control. Quantitative results in the dressing eluate correlate with those of the solid biofilm model. Overall, AG- and OCT-containing dressings did not achieve the expected anti-biofilm efficacy, while C-IOD performed best. Chemical interaction with the biofilms extrapolymeric substance (EPS), visualized in the SEM, and dressing configuration (agent concentration and release pattern) are suspected to be responsible. The unexpected low and diverse results of the tested antimicrobial dressings indicate a necessity to rethink non-debridement anti-biofilm therapy. Focussing on the combination of biofilm-disruptive (for EPS structure) and antimicrobial (for residing microorganisms) features, as with C-IOD, using dehydration and iodine, appears reasonably complementary and an optimal solution, as suggested by the here presented in vitro data.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,1,8,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,infection,11.5

,,Silver in Wound Care—Friend or Foe?: A Comprehensive Review,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Global Open,2019.0,"Background: Due to its strong antimicrobial activity, silver is a commonly used adjunct in wound care. However, it also has the potential to impair healing by exerting toxic effects on keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The published literature on the use of silver in wound care is very heterogeneous, making it difficult to generate useful treatment guidelines. Methods: A search of high-quality studies on the use of silver in wound care was performed on PubMed. A detailed qualitative analysis of published articles was performed to evaluate the evidence for the use of silver in infected wounds, clean wounds, burns, and over closed surgical incisions. Results: Fifty-nine studies were included in this qualitative analysis. We found that, overall, the quality of the published research on silver is poor. While there is some evidence for short-term use of dressings containing nanocrystalline silver in infected wounds, the use of silver-containing dressings in clean wounds and over closed surgical incisions is not indicated. Negative-pressure wound therapy accelerates the healing of contaminated wounds, especially when silver is used as an adjunct. For burns, silver sulfadiazine slows healing and should not be used. Instead, nanocrystalline silver, or alternatives such as octenidine and polyhexanide, lead to less infection and faster healing. Conclusions: In infected wounds, silver is beneficial for the first few days/weeks, after which nonsilver dressings should be used instead. For clean wounds and closed surgical incisions, silver confers no benefit. The ideal silver formulations are nanocrystalline silver and silver-coated polyurethane sponge for negative-pressure wound therapy. Silver sulfadiazine impairs wound healing. Proper use of silver-containing dressings is essential to optimize wound healing.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,1,19,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,infection,21.5

For the purposes of this article, Acticoat (Westaim Biomedical Inc, Fort Saskatchawan, Alberta, Canada) silver-coated dressing was used. After in vitro and in vivo studies, a randomized, prospective clinical study was performed to assess the efficacy and ease of use of Acticoat dressing as compared with the efficacy and ease of our institution's standard burn wound care. Thirty burn patients with symmetric wounds were randomized to be treated with either 0.5% silver nitrate solution or Acticoat silver-coated dressing. The dressing was evaluated on the basis of overall patient comfort, ease of use for the wound care provider, and level of antimicrobial effectiveness. Wound pain was rated by the patient using a visual analog scale during dressing removal, application, and 2 hours after application. Ease of use was rated by the nurse providing wound care. Antimicrobial effectiveness was evaluated by quantitative burn wound biopsies performed before and at the end of treatment. Patients found dressing removal less painful with Acticoat than with silver nitrate, but they found the pain to be comparable during application and 2 hours after application. According to the nurses, there was no statistically significant difference in the ease of use. The frequency of burn wound sepsis (> 10(5) organisms per gram of tissue) was less in Acticoat-treated wounds than in those treated with silver nitrate (5 vs 16). Secondary bacteremias arising from infected burn wounds were also less frequent with Acticoat than with silver nitrate-treated wounds (1 vs 5).

,10.1111/j.1742-481x.2012.01091.x,Appropriate use of silver dressings in wounds: International consensus document,International Wound Journal,2012.0,"Topical antimicrobial dressings, including those that contain silver, are currently used to prevent or treat infection in a wide range of acute and chronic wounds. Although silver dressings are being used extensively, a published randomised controlled trial (RCT) 1 and two Cochrane reviews 2, 3 concluded that there is insufficient evidence to show that silver dressings improve healing rates. The overall effect of these reports has been to cast doubt into the minds of healthcare purchasers, which has led to restrictions in the availability of silver dressings worldwide. There is growing concern amongst clinicians, who are involved in wound care, that arbitrary withdrawal of silver dressings could lead to their patients having increased morbidity and prolonged treatment time relating to uncontrolled wound bioburden. Because of this conflict of opinion, a group of experts from Europe, North America, the Fast East, South Africa and Australia met at the end of 2011 to provide internationally recognised guidance on the appropriate use of silver dressings, based on their experience in clinical practice and all the available published evidence. Additional international experts were also consulted to reflect practice across different parts of the world. Following this exercise, a consensus document was published that presents the mechanisms by which silver dressings work, the relationship of in vitro and in vivo evidence to clinical practice, and provides a rationale for cost-effective management 4. Many common misperceptions concerning the use of silver dressings were identified by the group. In contrast to the negative findings of the RCT and two meta-analyses 1-3, the experience of many clinicians and other meta-analyses have confirmed positive effects of silver dressings when they are used appropriately 5-7. This disparity is based on the use of complete healing as an endpoint, which is insisted upon by regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration of the USA in clinical trials of this nature. However, the use of silver dressings was never intended to directly promote wound healing but to control or reduce the bioburden of wounds, which if not addressed, does lead to delayed healing. The use of this more appropriate endpoint, control of bioburden, has been supported by many 8-12. Silver dressings are often perceived to be expensive, and although dressing unit costs are highly variable, their beneficial effects on overall cost of wound management and quality of life parameters are clear 13-17. Other misperceptions addressed in the consensus document are that silver dressings are unlikely to cause toxic local or systemic effects (although caution is suggested for use in large wounds, in children and in pregnancy/lactation), and that the risk of acquired antimicrobial resistance to silver (or to antibiotics) was negligible. Therefore, the appropriate use of all topical antiseptic dressings, such as those containing silver, is to reduce bioburden in wounds that are recalcitrant and often accompanied by progression of critical colonisation to infection. The antimicrobial effect of silver is mediated by the presence of the Ag+ ion which is disruptive to many aspects of micro-organism metabolism. This accounts for the broad spectrum of activity of silver dressings and their potential to destabilise biofilm matrices, there by reducing the risk of acquired resistance 18-22. The identification of critical colonisation and infection is a clinical one and should be made by experienced clinicians 12. The use of all topical antiseptic dressings ought to be accompanied by not just an assessment of the wound but also the management and re-assessment of underlying comorbidities; for which the aphorism of 'treat the patient as a whole, not just the hole in the patient' is entirely appropriate. In the consensus document it is recommended that silver dressings should be used for 2 weeks initially and then the wound, the patient and the management approach should be re-evaluated. The consensus group suggested that this initial 2-week period be seen as a 'challenge' period, during which the efficacy of the silver dressing can be assessed: when there is improvement, but persisting signs of infection, continue treatment without change; when there is improvement, but no signs of infection, discontinue all topical antimicrobials (including silver dressings); and when there is no improvement consider changing to a different antiseptic dressing, lavage/irrigant or gel, of if the patient is unwell, consider using systemic antibiotics and re-evaluating underlying comorbidities. In the absence of clear, level I evidence-based criteria, the choice of a silver dressing is likely to be based on availability and familiarity, the additional needs of the patient and the wound (such as the level of exudate production and condition of the wound bed), whether a secondary dressing is required and, of course, if there is an agreed patient preference. A current and comprehensive list of RCTs, and systematic reviews, of the use of the range of silver dressings and their indications for acute and chronic wounds is tabulated in the consensus document. In vitro tests of antimicrobial efficacy of silver dressings are less likely to influence the choice of silver dressing than published clinical studies. RCTs in this field have been criticised for being underpowered, with varied and sometimes inappropriate endpoints (such as complete healing) and poor randomisation, which have led to the varied findings of the meta-analyses alluded to earlier. Clinical endpoints of control of infection are more relevant, but microbiological endpoints can be confusing 23. However, RCTs are expensive and time consuming, and so are more likely to be undertaken by the manufacturers of silver dressings with all the attendant claims of conflicts of interest, which are perceived by many, despite the strict adherence to the code of good practice. Pragmatically, efficacy also needs to examine other evidence, such as observational studies, and expert and patient opinion 24. Areas where further experimental research and clinical trials may be directed could include: Clarification of the relationship between dressing formulation and the levels and rate of silver release. The sustained high release of Ag+ from dressings using nanocrystalline technology shows good short-term success. Greater understanding of the release of silver, which needs to be balanced with perceived, but possibly unwarranted,",OpenAlex,0,0,6,37,0,0,True,True,False,False,True,,,,,A,High,,antimicrobial,infection,56.0
,10.1002/dmrr.2700,IWGDF guidance on use of interventions to enhance the healing of chronic ulcers of the foot in diabetes,Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews,2015.0,"There is a clear need for evidence to substantiate the use of particular interventions in the management of chronic ulcers of the foot in diabetes. Following the completion of the latest of three systematic reviews undertaken over the last 10 years for the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) 1-3, the authors have formulated guidance on the use of interventions to enhance the healing of foot ulcers in diabetes, based on the evidence from all three reviews. The guidance is based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system of rating both the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. 1 Recommendations can be made to support an intervention, but also against the use of a particular intervention if there is no strong supporting evidence to justify its adoption. The guidance is divided into ten categories – the same as those used to group different types of intervention in the systematic reviews. The term debridement is here defined as the removal of surface debris, slough and necrotic and infected matter with the aim of leaving clean, viable tissue. Even though professional opinion is united in support of the use of debridement to clean the surface of the wound when possible, the experimental evidence to justify debridement in general and of any particular method of debridement is not strong. Debridement may be undertaken using physical (e.g. surgical, sharp or hydro-debridement), biological (larvae), autolytic (hydrogels) or biochemical (enzymes) methods. There is surprisingly little evidence on sharp or surgical debridement with only a single article included in one of the previous systematic reviews and that being a subgroup analysis from another trial 6. Despite this, the majority of national guidelines emphasize that sharp debridement 7-9 is an essential part of good wound care, taking relative contraindications such as severe ischemia into account. The available evidence from the three systematic reviews undertaken by the IWGDF, as published earlier in this journal, suggest that the use of hydrogels 10-12 as a means of debridement may have some benefit in terms of wound healing when compared with saline moistened gauze, but the risk of bias in the published studies was high – a conclusion supported by a Cochrane review 13. Similarly, the use of enzymatic or hydro-debridement cannot be supported by the available evidence, which is limited to one study on each method that qualified for inclusion 14, 15. The use of larval therapy is equally unsupported in these three reviews with only four small studies identified, each of which had a high risk of bias 16-19. Of interest, two recent large Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) of the use of larval therapy in venous leg ulcers have failed to demonstrate a benefit in terms of healing 20, 21. This does not mean that debridement is ineffective but simply that the studies have not been performed that provide robust evidence to support a strong recommendation. In general, however, clinicians should not adopt newer, more expensive, interventions unless they have been shown to have a greater impact on wound healing than existing methods. The three systematic reviews performed have looked at a number of different topical preparations designed to improve the healing of ulcers of the foot in diabetes. In general, the evidence to support the adoption of any particular intervention is poor, because the available studies are small and at high risk of bias. The results of an earlier positive study on a carboxymethylcellulose dressing 22 were not born out by a more recent large single blind RCT with low risk of bias 23. There is increasing interest in the use of surface antiseptics or antimicrobials, and although healing may not be the most obvious outcome measure to evaluate these agents, it is important that it is assessed in order to demonstrate the contribution it may make to the healing process. A single study reporting the use of antibiotic beads after transmetatarsal amputation found that this intervention had no impact on the incidence of wound healing 24. Honey has been used for centuries as an antimicrobial agent, and its appeal as a potential target for the management of chronic wounds is obvious. There is, however, little evidence to support its use for either the promotion of healing or the prevention of secondary infection. Over the three systematic reviews, only three small controlled studies on the use of honey were identified, and none showed convincing evidence of benefit when compared with an iodine-containing dressing 25-27. A Cochrane review of honey-based dressings in all wound types 28 concluded that health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available – a conclusion that is endorsed by the results of the current review. Other topical antimicrobials, such as silver-based or iodine-based dressings and applications, are also used frequently. Only one controlled trial of a silver-based dressing was identified in all three systematic reviews 29, and this demonstrated no convincing evidence of benefit. Similarly, a recent Cochrane review found no evidence of benefit from the use of antiseptic preparations in terms of either healing or secondary infection in any studies of infected or contaminated wounds 30. Similarly, a single large high-scoring multicentre RCT that compared a non-adherent dressing with an iodine-impregnated dressing and a carboxymethylcellulose hydrofibre dressing was reported in the 2012 review. This showed no difference between the three products in terms of either wound healing or the incidence of new infection 23. The conclusion for the whole group of topical interventions is that there was either insufficient or no evidence to justify the use of any of the preparations considered in preference to any other. In the absence of any specific indication, practitioners should use the dressing/application with the lowest acquisition cost but that supports moist wound healing while controlling any exudate.

Topical silver for treating infected wounds. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2007(1);CD005486. Clinical Question: What is the clinical evidence base for silver dressings in the management of contaminated and infected acute and chronic wounds? Data Sources: Investigations were identified by Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Register (2006), CENTRAL (2006), MEDLINE (2002–2006), EMBASE (2002–2006), CINAHL (2002–2006), and digital dissertations (2006) searches. Product manufacturers were contacted to identify additional eligible studies. The search terms included wound infection, surgical wound infection, ulcer, wound healing, and silver. Study Selection: Each study fulfilled the following criteria: (1) The study was a randomized controlled trial of human participants that compared dressings containing silver with any dressings without silver, dressings with other antiseptics, or dressings with different dosages of silver. (2) The participants were aged 18 years and older with contaminated and infected open wounds of any cause. (3) The study had to evaluate the effectiveness of the dressings using an objective measure of healing. No language or publication status restrictions were imposed, and participants could be recruited in any care setting. Studies were excluded if the wounds were ostomies (surgically formed passages). Data Extraction: Study quality assessment was conducted independently by 3 authors using the Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement and Dutch Cochrane Centre protocols. Characteristics of the study, participants, interventions, and outcome measures were extracted by one author and verified by a second using a standard form. The principal outcome measure was healing (time to complete healing, rate of change in wound area and volume, number and proportion of wounds healed within trial period). Secondary measures were adverse events (eg, pain, maceration, erythema), dressing leakage, and wound odor. Based on the unique comparisons in the studies, a meta-analysis was not conducted. As a result, summary estimates of treatment effect were calculated for each outcome comparison. RevMan software (version 4.2; Cochrane Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom) was used for statistical analysis. Main Results: Specific search criteria identified 31 studies for review, of which 3 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Lack of randomization and absence of wound infections excluded the majority of studies from the review. In the 3 studies selected, silver-containing dressings were compared with nonsilver dressings and dressings with other antimicrobials. One group used a silver-containing foam dressing and a nonsilver foam dressing; another group used a silver-containing alginate and a nonsilver alginate; and a third group used a silver-containing foam and various dressings (nonsilver foams, alginates, hydrocolloids, and gauze and other antimicrobial dressings). Sample sizes ranged between 99 and 619 participants. Most of the wounds in the included studies were pressure, diabetic, and venous leg ulcers. Wound infection was subjectively defined by 1 group as the presence of 2 or more signs and symptoms (eg, continuous pain, erythema, heat, or moderate to high levels of exudate) and by the other 2 groups as signs of critical colonization (eg, delayed healing, increased pain and exudate levels, discoloration, and odor). The primary measure in the included studies was healing outcome. The 3 groups used various assessments of healing, including relative and absolute reduction in wound area and number of wounds healed during the trial period. The trial period in each study was 4 weeks. In the 3 trials, the authors randomized the participants to the treatment groups. Examining healing, one group (129 participants) compared Contreet silver foam (Coloplast A/S, Humlebaek, Denmark) with Allevyn foam (Smith &amp; Nephew, St-Laurent, Quebec, Canada). The authors reported no differences for rates of complete healing (risk difference [RD] = 0.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.09, 0.09) and median wound area reduction (weighted mean difference [WMD] = −0.30 cm2, 95% CI = −2.92, 2.35). However, Contreet was favored over Allevyn (P = .034) for median relative reduction in wound area (WMD = −15.70 cm2, 95% CI = −29.5, −1.90). One group (99 participants) compared Silvercel silver alginate (Johnson &amp; Johnson Wound Management, Somerville, NJ) with Algosteril alginate (Johnson &amp; Johnson Wound Management). The authors found no differences in rates of complete healing (RD = 0.00, 95% CI = −0.06, 0.05), mean absolute (WMD = 4.50 cm2, 95% CI = −0.93, 9.93) and relative wound area reduction (WMD = −0.30 cm2, 95% CI = −17.08, 16.48), or healing rate per day (week 1 to 4) (WMD = 0.16 cm2, 95% CI = −0.03, 0.35). One group (619 participants) compared Contreet with various dressings (nonsilver foams, alginates, hydrocolloids, and gauze and other antimicrobial dressings). For median relative wound area reduction, the authors noted a superiority of Contreet over the various dressings (P = .0019). Examining secondary outcomes, 2 groups used subjective analysis to compare adverse reactions among the dressings. One group reported no difference between Contreet (in satellite ulcers, deterioration of periwound tissue) and Allevyn (in satellite ulcers, maceration, eczema) (RD = 0.02, 95% CI = −0.07, 0.12), and one group found no difference between Silvercel (in pain during dressing change, eczema, periwound erythema, maceration) and Algosteril (in pain during dressing change, eczema, erythema) (RD = −0.01, 95% CI = −0.12, 0.11). Two groups subjectively assessed leakage among silver and nonsilver dressings. The data from one group demonstrated superiority of Contreet over Allevyn (P = .002; RD = −0.30, 95% CI = −0.47, −0.13), and one group found Contreet better than various dressings (eg, nonsilver foams, alginates, hydrocolloids, and gauze, and other antimicrobial dressings) (P = .0005; RD = −0.11, 95% CI = −0.18, −0.05). Using a subjective 4-point scale, one group compared silver and nonsilver dressings and reported a difference favoring Contreet over Allevyn in terms of wound odor (P = .030; RD = −0.19, 95% CI = −0.36, −0.03). Conclusions: Overall, this review provides no clear evidence to support the use of silver-containing foam and alginate dressings in the management of infected chronic wounds for up to 4 weeks. However, the use of silver foam dressings resulted in a greater reduction in wound size and more effective control of leakage and odor than did use of nonsilver dressings.

An overview and critique of the VULCAN study on silver dressings,International Wound Journal,2011.0,"The VULCAN study results were published in 2009 supported by the HTA and published in the British Journal of Surgery (1). As a multicentre, prospective randomised controlled trial, its objective was to examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial silver dressings in treating venous leg ulcers. Patients were recruited from two different areas of the UK, South Yorkshire and Devon. Silver dressings were compared with non-antimicrobial, low-adherent control dressings. A total of 304 patients were recruited, all with venous ulceration of the lower leg that had been present for more than 6 weeks, of whom 213 participated in the trial, and 91 underwent observation only. Participants were randomised to receive either an antimicrobial silver dressing (n = 107) or a control dressing (n = 106). Both dressings were applied underneath compression bandages or hosiery. The choice of dressing type was made by the treating clinician; the silver dressing was selected from an approved list (Aquacel® Ag, Acticoat™, Acticoat™ 7, Acticoat™ Absorbent, Contreet® Foam and Urgotul® SSD), and the control dressing was specified as any non-antimicrobial dressing from any manufacturer. Clinical assessment by the treating clinician was used to evaluate dressing effectiveness, with a primary outcome measure of complete healing at 12 weeks. Costs and resource use, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cost-effectiveness, time to healing, and recurrence rates at 6 months and 1 year were used as secondary outcome measures. The study authors found no significant differences between the two groups for the number of ulcers healed at 12 weeks (59.6% in the silver dressing group, and 56.7% in the control group), and overall median time to healing (P = 0.408). No significant difference between the two dressing types was found in either primary or secondary endpoints. Geographical differences were seen in treating clinician preference for dressing type – Urgotul® SSD was more commonly used in the north, whereas Acticoat™ 7 or Aquacel® Ag was more commonly used in the south. The authors concluded that no significant benefits in venous leg ulcer healing were associated with the use of silver dressings, and that these dressings were also associated with a greater incremental cost per patient (£97.85), compared with non-antimicrobial, low-adherent control dressings. This cost was determined from both the increased cost of the dressings themselves, and also from an increase in the number of dressing changes recorded in the silver dressing group. The authors state that their findings of lack of benefit from silver dressings were robust, with no suggestion of particular benefit associated with any of the dressing types, or in particular patient subgroups (1). They comment that silver dressings are widely used within the NHS, and that introduction of new dressings should be investigated more carefully using large well-designed research studies before widespread use. They conclude that their results suggest no indication for the general and regular use of antimicrobial dressings to promote venous ulcer healing, and recommend the use of less-expensive low- or non-adherent dressings in these wound types. This study provides some interesting and thought-provoking results, but it has a number of limitations. The main clinical indication for use of antiseptics (including silver) is to prevent the progression of 'critical colonisation', infection or recurrence of infection in those patients who have chronic wounds and are at increased risk (i.e. those with burns, who are immunocompromised, or those in whom patient or systemic factors mean that wounds are unlikely to heal), or to treat established localised or spreading infection in chronic wounds. Discontinuation is recommended when the signs of infection resolve, or the wound starts to heal, and indiscriminate or indefinite use of antiseptics is not recommended (2). The main indication of silver dressing use is not to promote wound healing (3). The VULCAN study therefore did not use these dressings as recommended. It also did not address how to manage patients with non-healing, critically colonised or infected ulcers, or those unable to tolerate compression. The researchers only considered one type of chronic wound (venous ulcers), which have a lower risk of infection than wounds such as burns and skin grafts, where silver dressings have had demonstrable benefits (4). Silver dressings were used for a prolonged time period (up to 12 weeks) on wounds which were not infected, which is contrary to current recommended best practice (5). The length of time of dressing use and number of changes were also inconsistent across the study. The treating clinicians were also allowed free choice of silver dressing from an approved list of six different types (which offer very different properties), and the study does not report whether the dressing type chosen affected wound healing. As these dressing types are made differently, by different manufacturers and vary considerably in structure, composition and silver content (although all indicated for venous ulcers), one could argue that relying on clinician choice may introduce bias – particularly as some dressing types were indeed more popular than others. Urgotul® SSD was the most commonly used (39.6%), followed by Acticoat™ 7 (27.5%), and a distinct clinician preference was also observed between the two geographical areas of the study. A further potential bias is introduced by allowing free clinician choice of any non-antimicrobial dressing from any manufacturer. Demographic data and healing rates also differed geographically in the VULCAN study, with the northern population being younger overall and having greater co-morbidity associated with worse rates of healing – another factor that could introduce bias, which was acknowledged by the study authors. The fact that the study was conducted in only two geographical areas, which differed demographically, suggests that more comprehensive results would be obtained by using a greater number of study areas, which would give a less restrictive picture of healing rates in the general population. The use of antiseptics on wounds is an issue which has been widely debated. The main argument for use of antiseptics on open wounds is to prevent and treat infection, therefore promoting the healing process. All chronic wounds are colonised by bacteria, and antiseptics may have advantages over antibiotics as they will not promote",OpenAlex,0,0,6,30,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,antimicrobial,infection,44.0

With numerous disease processes, the cascade of events involved in wound healing can be affected, resulting in chronic, non-healing wounds that subject the patient to significant discomfort and distress while draining the medical system of an enormous amount of resources. The healing of a superficial wound requires many factors to work in concert, and wound dressings and treatments have evolved considerably to address possible barriers to wound healing, ranging from infection to hypoxia. Even optimally, wound tissue never reaches its pre-injured strength and multiple aberrant healing states can result in chronic non-healing wounds.

It has been estimated that the annual incidence of diabetic foot ulceration ranges between 2% and 4% in developed countries and this prevalence may be even higher in developing countries due to socio-economic differences and variations in standards of care. In 1996, the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) was founded with a vision to reduce the global impact of diabetic foot complications. They have been publishing and revising international ‘Practical Guidelines’ with a view to improving the delivery of foot care to persons with diabetes ever since. In 2007, three working groups of independent experts in the field produced evidence-based consensus reports on ‘footwear and offloading’, ‘wound management’ and ‘osteomyelitis’. In 2009, the IWGDF invited three working groups to produce new guidelines on peripheral arterial disease (PAD), wound healing and infection based on a series of systematic reviews. These guidelines were revised in 2011 to align with advances in research and clinical practice. The 2015 IWGDF ‘Guidance’ documents on the prevention and management of foot problems in diabetes were recently launched at the Seventh International Symposium on the Diabetic Foot in May 2015. They present some new insights into developments in the diagnosis, prognosis and management of peripheral arterial disease in persons with diabetes, causing foot ulcers, an evidence-based consensus on the use of interventions to enhance healing of chronic ulcers on the foot in persons with diabetes, and guidance on the diagnosis and management of foot infections in persons with diabetes. In contrast to former IWGDF ‘Practical Guidelines’ the 2015 ‘Guidance’ documents have been expanded to include an evidence-based consensus on the prevention of foot ulcers in at-risk persons with diabetes, and guidance on footwear and offloading to prevent and heal foot ulcers in persons with diabetes. In addition to the five documents the IWGDF Editorial Board produced a summary guidance for daily practice for health care providers around the world that are involved in the care of people with diabetes. The 2015 updates are based on a series of systematic reviews and these recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Table 1 outlines the recommendations on enhancing the healing of chronic DFU based on strength of evidence and the quality of evidence presented in the literature. These recommendations consist of nine interventions that are relevant to the field of wound healing. There are a number of small studies that demonstrate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and topical negative pressure wound therapy but these interventions are associated with high cost and there are very few studies confirming their effectiveness in routine clinical practice. A recent systematic review performed an analysis on the value of HBOT in healing DFU and preventing amputations. The review concluded that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that HBOT was effective in improving the healing of DFU in patients with concomitant ischaemia. However, the authors acknowledged that larger trials of higher quality were required to ascertain if implementing HBOT in routine clinical practice could be justified 1. The over use of anti-microbial dressings to improve DFU healing times or prevent secondary infection in routine clinical practice is controversial. It has been proposed that long term use of antimicrobial dressings on colonised wounds may increase the risk of resistance and is less cost effective when compared against the cost of a conventional inert sterile dressing. Furthermore, a controversial review of the literature suggests that there is insufficient evidence to show that silver dressings improve healing rates 2 and these findings are reflected in the global consensus recommendations for a range of interventions designed to enhance the healing of chronic DFU. The recommendations outlined in the 2015 IWGDF Guidance documents demonstrate an inclusive approach to developing standards of care which can be delivered by health care providers irrespective of the socio-economic differences that may exist between developed and developing countries around the world. They have succeeded in publishing quality standards of care for people with diabetes regardless of geographic location or social status by incorporating the five cornerstones of prevention and management of foot problems within an evidence-based framework.",OpenAlex,0,0,3,2,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,antimicrobial,14.5
,,The Use of Silver Products in the Management of Burn Wounds: Change in Practice for the Burn Unit at Royal Perth Hospital,Primary intention,2005.0,"The aim of this paper is to describe and discuss the properties and applications of silver in the management of burn wounds. Recent renewed interest in silver has resulted in the development of new silver delivery systems. Silver is a broad spectrum antibiotic with antiseptic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and pro-healing properties. Free silver cations released in a wound have a potent antimicrobial effect, destroying bacteria by the process of cell replication inhibition, blocking cellular respiration and cell functional structure. Research indicates that the effectiveness of the silver dressing is related to the bacterial burden in the wound and the delivery of silver must be at the right concentration over an appropriate time. Research into silver toxicity reveals low mammalian toxicity; 'agyria' is the most common side effect. There is limited documentation on silver bacterial resistance. Burn wounds are susceptible to infection, often exacerbated by immuno-suppression associated with burn injury. Burn wound infections remain the main cause of mortality and morbidity for patients with burn injuries. The common silver products used in burn wound management are silver sulphadiazine cream (SSD), Flammercerium, silver nitrate 0.5% solution, ActicoatTM, Acticoat Absorbent, Aquacel Ag and silver hydrocolloids such as ContreetH. Several investigations found that Acticoat is more effective than other silver dressings. The burn unit at Royal Perth Hospital, after conducting patient care audits to evaluate the effectiveness of Acticoat as compared to SilvazineTM, found Acticoat more effective and cost effective. The unit subsequently changed their practice of early burn wound management to Acticoat dressings for all partial to full thickness burn admissions.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,19,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,infection,20.5

,10.1002/14651858.cd003557.pub4,Antibiotics and antiseptics for venous leg ulcers,Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2013.0,"Background Venous leg ulcers are a type of chronic wound affecting up to 1% of adults in developed countries at some point during their lives. Many of these wounds are colonised by bacteria or show signs of clinical infection. The presence of infection may delay ulcer healing. Two main strategies are used to prevent and treat clinical infection in venous leg ulcers: systemic antibiotics and topical antibiotics or antiseptics. Objectives The objective of this review was to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics and topical antibiotics and antiseptics on the healing of venous ulcers; review authors also examined the effects of these interventions on clinical infection, bacterial flora, bacterial resistance, ulcer recurrence, adverse effects, patient satisfaction, health‐related quality of life and costs. Search methods In May 2013, for this second update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 24 May 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (1948 to Week 3 May 2013); Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐indexed Citations, 22 May 2013); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to Week 20 2013); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 17 May 2013). No language or publication date restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting people with venous leg ulceration, evaluating at least one systemic antibiotic, topical antibiotic or topical antiseptic that reported an objective assessment of wound healing (e.g. time to complete healing, frequency of complete healing, change in ulcer surface area) were eligible for inclusion. Selection decisions were made by two review authors while working independently. Data collection and analysis Information on the characteristics of participants, interventions and outcomes was recorded on a standardised data extraction form. In addition, aspects of trial methods were extracted, including randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data and study group comparability at baseline. Data extraction and validity assessment were conducted by one review author and were checked by a second. Data were pooled when appropriate. Main results Forty‐five RCTs reporting 53 comparisons and recruiting a total of 4486 participants were included, Many RCTs were small, and most were at high or unclear risk of bias. Ulcer infection status at baseline and duration of follow‐up varied across RCTs. Five RCTs reported eight comparisons of systemic antibiotics, and the remainder evaluated topical preparations: cadexomer iodine (11 RCTs reporting 12 comparisons); povidone‐iodine (six RCTs reporting seven comparisons); peroxide‐based preparations (four RCTs reporting four comparisons); honey‐based preparations (two RCTs reporting two comparisons); silver‐based preparations (12 RCTs reporting 13 comparisons); other topical antibiotics (three RCTs reporting five comparisons); and other topical antiseptics (two RCTs reporting two comparisons). Few RCTs provided a reliable estimate of time to healing; most reported the proportion of participants with complete healing during the trial period. Systemic antibiotics More participants were healed when they were prescribed levamisole (normally used to treat roundworm infection) compared with placebo: risk ratio (RR) 1.31 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.62). No between‐group differences were detected in terms of complete healing for other comparisons: antibiotics given according to antibiogram versus usual care; ciprofloxacin versus standard care/placebo; trimethoprim versus placebo; ciprofloxacin versus trimethoprim; and amoxicillin versus topical povidone‐iodine. Topical antibiotics and antiseptics Cadexomer iodine: more participants were healed when given cadexomer iodine compared with standard care. The pooled estimate from four RCTs for complete healing at four to 12 weeks was RR 2.17 (95% CI 1.30 to 3.60). No between‐group differences in complete healing were detected when cadexomer iodine was compared with the following: hydrocolloid dressing; paraffin gauze dressing; dextranomer; and silver‐impregnated dressings. Povidone iodine: no between‐group differences in complete healing were detected when povidone‐iodine was compared with the following: hydrocolloid; moist or foam dressings according to wound status; and growth factor. Time to healing estimates for povidone‐iodine versus dextranomer, and for povidone‐iodine versus hydrocolloid, were likely to be unreliable. Peroxide‐based preparations: four RCTs reported findings in favour of peroxide‐based preparations when compared with usual care for surrogate healing outcomes (change in ulcer area). There was no report of complete healing. Honey‐based preparations: no between‐group difference in time to healing or complete healing was detected for honey‐based products when compared with usual care. Silver‐based preparations: no between‐group differences in complete healing were detected when 1% silver sulphadiazine ointment was compared with standard care/placebo and tripeptide copper complex; or when different brands of silver‐impregnated dressings were compared; or when silver‐impregnated dressings were compared with non‐antimicrobial dressings. Other topical antibiotics: data from one RCT suggested that more participants healed at four weeks when treated with an enzymatic cleanser (a non‐antibiotic preparation) compared with a chloramphenicol‐containing ointment (additional active ingredients also included in the ointment): RR 0.13 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.99). No between‐group differences in complete healing were detected for framycetin sulphate ointment versus enzymatic cleanser; chloramphenicol ointment versus framycetin sulphate ointment; mupirocin ointment versus vehicle; and topical antibiotics given according to antibiogram versus an herbal ointment. Other topical antiseptics: data from one RCT suggested that more participants receiving an antiseptic ointment (ethacridine lactate) had responsive ulcers (defined as > 20% reduction in area) at four weeks when compared with placebo: RR 1.45 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.73). Complete healing was not reported. No between‐group difference was detected between chlorhexidine solution and usual care. Authors' conclusions At present, no evidence is available to support the routine use of systemic antibiotics in promoting healing of venous leg ulcers. However, the lack of reliable evidence means that it is not possible to recommend the discontinuation of any of the agents reviewed. In terms of topical preparations, some evidence supports the use of cadexomer iodine. Current evidence does not support the routine use of honey‐ or silver‐based products. Further good quality research is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of povidone‐iodine, peroxide‐based preparations, ethacridine lactate, chloramphenicol, framycetin, mupirocin, ethacridine or chlorhexidine in healing venous leg ulceration. In light of the increasing problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, current prescribing guidelines recommend that antibacterial preparations should be used only in cases of clinical infection, not for bacterial colonisation.",OpenAlex,0,0,7,11,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,antimicrobial,infection,31.5
,10.4103/2229-5178.137829,Summary of recommendations for leg ulcers,Indian Dermatology Online Journal,2014.0,"INTRODUCTION Leg ulcers are debilitating and painful, greatly reducing patient's quality of life. These ulcers are often difficult to treat and the successful treatment of leg ulcers depends upon the accurate diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause. According to most of the Western and European studies, the most common type of leg ulcer is venous ulcer the others being neuropathic ulcer and arterial ulcers. These three kinds of ulcers account for almost 90% of cases of lower leg ulceration.[1] In tropical countries like India, there is a paucity of epidemiological studies regarding prevalence and etiology of leg ulcers. A study from one center in India suggests leprosy (40%), diabetes (23%), venous disease (11%), and trauma (13%) causes of lower extremity wounds.[2] The following evidence-based recommendations are in general to lower leg ulcers without referring to any specific cause of ulcerations and adherence to these will lead to speedy healing of lower leg ulcerations. RECOMMENDATIONS Clinical assessment Clinical history and examination of leg and ulcer (Level B) Clinical assessment includes full clinical history and physical examination of the patient of leg ulcer presenting either first time or with recurrent leg ulcer. In history, the duration/recurrence of an ulcer, pain, trauma, comorbid factors, and associated medical causes should be considered. The comorbid factors such as old age, malnutrition, poor hygiene, intravenous drug abuse, obesity, varicose veins, deep vein thrombosis, and coexisting medical causes such as diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic vasculitis adversely affect both prognosis, and outcome of the treatment. Examination of both legs should be done, which includes palpation of peripheral pulses, edema if present whether it is pitting or nonpitting type, signs of venous hypertension such as varicose veins, hemosiderin pigmentation, varicose eczema, atrophie blanche, and lipodermatosclerosis should be noted. The range of hip, knee, and ankle movement should be determined, and sensation should be tested to exclude peripheral neuropathy (evidence Level B).[123456] Clinical assessment of ulcer includes the assessment of site, size, depth, edge, margins, floor, base, and condition of the surrounding skin. The site of the ulcer medial, lateral, anterior, posterior, or combination should be noticed, this give clue to the underlying etiology of the ulcer. The size and surface area of the ulcer is determined by measuring the two maximum perpendicular axis, tracing the margins, and clinical photography. The surface area of the ulcer should be serially measured over time (evidence Level C).[78] A study compared the accuracy of ulcer measurement from digital images with contact tracing, and it was found that the two methods were equally accurate and reproducible, but that the digital image measurement was significantly quicker and offered a number advantages (evidence Level C).[9] Vascular assessment In patients with lower extremity ulcers, the accurate assessment of the arterial and venous systems is necessary to establish the diagnosis and essential for adequate treatment selection (Level B).[10111213141516171819] Doppler measurement of ankle/brachial pressure index All patients presenting with an ulcer should be screened for arterial disease by Doppler measurement of ankle/brachial pressure index (ABPI) (evidence Level B).[101112131415] Ankle/brachial pressure index: Is an objective evidence to substantiate the presence or absence of significant peripheral arterial disease (except in heavily calcified vessels) is the ratio of the ankle to brachial systolic pressure and can be measured using a sphygmomanometer and hand held Doppler device. The significance of its assessment is highlighted by the fact that compression therapy can be safely applied to patients with ABPI >0.8 (evidence Level C).[1012] Compression applied to legs with arterial insufficiency could result in pressure damage, limb ischemia, and even amputation. Doppler ultrasound to measure ABPI should also be conducted when the ulcer is deteriorating, ulcer not healed fully by 12 weeks, sudden increase in size of ulcer, sudden increase in pain, foot color or temperature change, or there is recurrence of ulcer (evidence Level B).[131415] Role of color flow Doppler imaging in arterial disease Color flow Doppler imaging is advantageous over ABPI measurements in cases in which wounds and ulcers prevent the use of a cuff for measuring ABPI (evidence Level D).[16] Color flow Doppler imaging quantifies any proximal arterial disease (aortoiliac) and the degree of involvement of distal vessels. And in addition, may detect nonflow limiting lesions to nonaxial arteries such as the deep femoral artery or lesions limited to a single tibial artery.[16] Role of venous color flow Doppler imaging It is a gold standard investigation for the assessment of the venous system of lower limb (evidence Level B).[1516171819] This noninvasive modality has revolutionized the diagnostic approach to venous disorders. It assesses the superficial, deep or perforating veins separately for the presence of obstruction and reflux. Absence of flow is considered as obstruction and reflux is defined as the retrograde flow lasting more than 0.5 s, which is the time required for valve closure. It is highly recommended in the setting of venous ulcers. Biopsy Referral to a specialist unit for biopsy should be considered if the appearance of the ulcer is atypical or if there is deterioration or failure to progress after 12 weeks of active treatment (evidence Level C).[18202122] Bacteriological evaluation Bacteriological swabbing is unnecessary unless there is evidence of clinical infections such as inflammation, redness, cellulitis, increased pain, purulent exudates, rapid deterioration of the ulcer, pyrexia, and foul odor (evidence Level B).[212223] Bacteriological swabs have certain limitations the swab cultures typically show the presence of numerous organisms, which have little or no clinical relevance, there is no standard technique for obtaining a swab culture, which shows reproducible results, inappropriate technique for taking swabs like from necrotic or nonviable tissue and they lack the ability to differentiate between bacteria resting on the wound surface versus infecting organisms. There are no reports in the literature that validate the use of swab cultures in chronic wounds.[22] However, a quantitative tissue biopsy should be obtained if there is no progression of the wound after 2 weeks of standard treatment (evidence Level B).[222425] The gold standard for the treatment of infection is >105 colony-forming units of bacteria per gram",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,1.5

The advances in deployed and en route combat casualty care are categorized as individual RMMAs shown in Table 1. As with prehospital advances, the basis for many of the RMMAs in the deployed hospital care environment as well as en route care was translated from civilian trauma practice but is realistic and relevant to the battlefield context. As the conflict evolved, the substantive data from the battlefield led to many new paradigms of treatment and evacuation. The successful implementation of many of these battlefield practices was then effectively translated back into the civilian injury care environment as has been typical of medical advances developed subsequent to previous conflicts of antiquity.TABLE 1: RMMAs, 2001 to 2011 OCOs in Afghanistan and Iraq.The RMMAs that occurred during the last 10 years of combat casualty care are in the realm of deployed hospital care and en route care and are discussed in detail in this article. DEPLOYED HOSPITAL CARE Global Combat Damage-Control Surgery Damage-control surgery is well established in civilian trauma centers and is described as the trilogy of abbreviated operation, intensive care stabilization/resuscitation, and the return to the operating room for the last or multistage procedures for the definitive surgical repair. This paradigm has reduced mortality for the patient population with severe abdominal injuries1 and has gained widespread acceptance. In the civilian trauma systems, this trilogy usually occurs in one hospital. This approach has been described for all anatomic injuries in the severely injured patient at risk for physiologic decompensation.2,3,4 In contrast to the civilian damage control, global combat damage-control surgery often involves multiple separate surgical facilities, multiple surgeons, multiple resuscitation and stabilization episodes, helicopter evacuation, and fixed-wing evacuations by the Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) during a multistage global transit (Fig. 1).4–5Figure 1: Global combat damage-control surgery.Global combat damage control has been successfully conducted for thousands of combat-wounded patients within a matter of several days and represents a profound revolutionary change in the care of patients severely wounded in combat. Damage-Control Resuscitation Damage-control resuscitation (DCR) is one of the most significant RMMAs to develop from the overseas contingency operations (OCOs) in Iraq and Afghanistan. As introduced in a 2007 special commentary by Holcomb et al.,6 DCR is described as ""a structured intervention [which] begins immediately after rapid initial assessment in the ED and progresses through the OR into the ICU. All efforts are directed towards this goal of preventing/correcting hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy by repeated point of care testing and the use of multiple blood products and drugs readily available in theater, albeit in new ratios and amounts."" DCR consists of two major efforts as follows: permissive hypotension to prevent excessive bleeding and hemostatic resuscitation, which stresses the administration of blood products in a 1:1:1 manner.5 Most trauma patients are not coagulopathic and do not require blood product resuscitation. However, up to 25% of severely bleeding trauma patients present with acute coagulopathy, and mortality in these patients can be as high as 50%. During the course of the last decade, the US military medical community has developed the concept of DCR to treat this subset of critically injured patients. This revolutionary change improved doctrine developed in the latter half of the 20th century. The cornerstone of the DCR revolution is the aggressive use of blood products including packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets in ratios near 1:1:1. Military studies conducted during the Iraq war suggested that patients receiving higher ratios of FFP to PRBCs had lower mortality rates (19% vs. 65%) compared with those who received lower ratios (1:8).6 Similar results have been found in the civilian setting, where a retrospective analysis of patients receiving massive transfusions found a lower mortality (26% vs. 87.5%) in those who received FFP/PRBC in a higher ratio.7 Current military DCR clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) state that, ""The goal of transfusion of the patient with need for massive transfusion is to deliver a ratio of PRBCs to plasma to platelets of 1:1:1.""8 As soon as patients arrive to the emergency department and are identified as likely to require massive transfusion, the DCR protocol is initiated; thawed plasma is used as a primary resuscitation fluid in a 1:1 ratio with PRBCs. This process continues through the operating room and into the intensive care unit. Crystalloid use is thereby significantly limited, as are other resuscitative adjuncts such as cryoprecipitate and tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA in Trauma Resuscitation The landmark CRASH-2 trial testing the safety and efficacy of TXA in trauma resuscitation marked a turning point in the treatment of trauma patients. For the first time, a single pharmaceutical intervention was shown to reduce mortality in hemorrhaging trauma patients. This study documented the benefit of TXA in real-world clinical practice across a wide variety of settings, including austere environments. Reinforcing the revolutionary findings of CRASH-2, an analysis of early use of TXA by United Kingdom physicians at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Role 3 Bastion hospital in Afghanistan documented similar results in combat casualties.9 In this study of 896 casualties, 32.7% (n = 293) received TXA, while 67.2% (n = 603) did not. The patients receiving TXA had a higher survival rate (82.6% vs. 76.1%; p = 0.028) than the massive transfusion subgroup receiving TXA (28.1% vs. 14.4%; p = 0.004). Multivariate regression modeling of the massive transfusion cohort showed that TXA use was independently associated with survival (odds ratio [OR], 7.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.02–17.32). TXA is the first targeted therapy to be proven effective in hemorrhaging trauma patients, and CRASH-2 provides Level I evidence to support its use. TXA has been incorporated into the Joint Trauma System CPG for DCR and has been recommended as an option prehospital by the Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care and the Defense Health Board (DHB memo, TXA).

,10.1089/wound.2012.0401,Wound Dressings and Comparative Effectiveness Data,Advances in Wound Care,2013.0,"Significance: Injury to the skin provides a unique challenge, as wound healing is a complex and intricate process. Acute wounds have the potential to move from the acute wound to chronic wounds, requiring the physician to have a thorough understanding of outside interventions to bring these wounds back into the healing cascade. Recent Advances: The development of new and effective interventions in wound care remains an area of intense research. Negative pressure wound therapy has undoubtedly changed wound care from this point forward and has proven beneficial for a variety of wounds. Hydroconductive dressings are another category that is emerging with studies underway. Other modalities such as hyperbaric oxygen, growth factors, biologic dressings, skin substitutes, and regenerative materials have also proven efficacious in advancing the wound-healing process through a variety of mechanisms. Critical Issues: There is an overwhelming amount of wound dressings available in the market. This implies the lack of full understanding of wound care and management. The point of using advanced dressings is to improve upon specific wound characteristics to bring it as close to “ideal” as possible. It is only after properly assessing the wound characteristics and obtaining knowledge about available products that the “ideal” dressing may be chosen. Future Directions: The future of wound healing at this point remains unknown. Few high-quality, randomized controlled trials evaluating wound dressings exist and do not clearly demonstrate superiority of many materials or categories. Comparative effectiveness research can be used as a tool to evaluate topical therapy for wound care moving into the future.

,10.1111/wrr.12395,Wound healing society 2014 update on guidelines for arterial ulcers,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2015.0,"The Wound Healing Society guidelines for the treatment of arterial insufficiency ulcers were originally published in 2006. These guidelines provided recommendations, along with their respective levels of evidence on seven categories: diagnosis, surgery, infection control, wound bed preparation, dressings, adjuvant therapy, and long-term maintenance. Over the last 7 years, a great deal of literature regarding these aspects of arterial ulcer management has been published. An advisory panel comprised of academicians, clinicians, and researchers was chosen to update the 2006 guidelines. Members included vascular surgeons, internists, plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, emergency medicine physicians, and registered nurses, all with expertise in wound healing. The goal of this article is to evaluate relevant new findings, upon which an updated version of the guidelines will be based. Data sources and searches We sought to capture the highest quality of literature available regarding arterial insufficiency ulcer diagnosis and treatment using a key word search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Similarly, the citations of relevant articles were examined by hand. Key terms were generated from the existing guidelines. The search was limited to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective series reviews, clinical case series, and expert panel recommendations published between January 2006 and 2013. It was further limited to only English publications, and review articles and case reports were excluded. The findings of these articles have been divided into one or more of the appropriate categories (diagnosis, surgery, infection control, wound bed preparation, dressings, adjuvant therapy, and long-term maintenance) as performed in the original guideline. Guideline 1.1: The reliability of capillary refill time as an indicator of tissue perfusion is questionable. Principle: Using the capillary refill test with finger pressure on the dorsum of the dependent foot to measure microcirculatory supply has not been validated. Skin perfusion pressure is a good indicator of lower extremity microcirculation and transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) is a good indicator for critical limb ischemia (CLI).1–8 Evidence: Guideline 1.2: Audio handheld Doppler waveforms are diagnostic of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and triphasic pulse is reliable to rule out significant PAD. Principle: Audible Doppler signal sounds are effective for the detection or exclusion of PAD compared with the ankle brachial pressure index (ABI). Triphasic waveforms from audio handheld Doppler can rule out PAD in asymptomatic low risk patients.1–3 Evidence: Guideline 1.3: Pulse wave velocity may be useful in screening and evaluating the severity of PAD. Principle: Nondiabetic vascular patients can have significant arterial stiffness independent of an impaired ABI. Increased pulse-wave velocity reflecting upon arterial stiffness shows an excellent correlation with decreased values of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation.1–4 Evidence: Guideline 1.4: Diagnosis of PAD by manual palpation of lower limb pulses is a reliable method when resources are limited. Principle: Primary care physicians are not well versed with the use of Doppler for diagnosis of PAD. Initial cost of the equipment is another adverse factor in low-income countries. Detection of ankle systolic pressure by palpatory method may offer a cheap, simple and useful alternative approach in office care settings for early detection of PAD. However, a palpable pulse does not rule out PAD, particularly in diabetic patients with medical calcinosis. Given the common occurrence of medial calcinosis in patients with diabetes, Toe-Brachial-Pressure-Index is the recommended screening test.1–7 Evidence: Preamble: In patients with arterial insufficiency ulcers, restoration of blood flow by revascularization is the intervention that will most likely lead to healing.1–3 Evidence: Guideline #2.1: Prior to revascularization, an anatomic road map should be obtained. (Level II) Principle: The goal of revascularization (open or endovascular) is to restore in-line arterial blood flow to the ulcer, which may be manifested by a pulse in the foot and/or improved ABI.1 Evidence: Guideline #2.2: In the presence of an arterial ulceration, the natural history is one of disease progression and eventual limb loss, and the treatment options are revascularization (endovascular or open surgery) or amputation. Adjuvant therapies may improve healing of the ulcer but do not correct the underlying vascular disease. They cannot replace revascularization. Revascularization is not always successful and durable. Thus, adjuvant therapy may improve the outcome if combined with revascularization. (Level II). Principle: Approximately 10–20% of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease will need revascularization surgery. Bypass surgery has a reported patency rate of 70% for crural-pedal bypass in both diabetics and nondiabetics at 5 years (in survivors), a limb salvage rate of 80% with a 1–2% amputation rate at 2 years in both diabetics and nondiabetics (the same in diabetics), and a limb salvage rate of 80% with 1–2% amputation rate at 5 years.1–3 Surgical results for distal dorsalis pedis bypass: at 5 years, the primary patency is 57%, whereas the secondary patency is 63% and limb salvage is 78% (only 49% alive). At 10 years, the primary patency is 38%, whereas the secondary patency is 42% and limb salvage is 56% (only 24% alive).2–4 Endovascular results reported an 80% 2-year limb salvage (small series). Evidence: Guideline #2.3: The risk of surgery should be weighed against the likelihood of success (of revascularization and of healing of the ulcer after revascularization) given a patient's comorbidities. (Level II). Principle: Revascularization does not always result in a perfused foot and does not always lead to adequate inflow of oxygen to guarantee ulcer healing in the foot. For example, patients with heel gangrene and end-stage renal disease may be considered for primary amputation (controversial: palpable pedal pulse not indicative of healing, as they have lower rates of limb salvage and higher rates of complications). However, care must be individualized. In some cases, limb preservation may be important to the patient because of issues of body image or in cases where limited function is possible and may still allow the patient to maintain independence with transfers. In addition, the risk of amputation needs to be considered in this complex risk–benefit analysis. Providers should discuss the risks and benefits clearly with the patient and determine the patient preference.1–5 Evidence: Guideline #2.4: The role of endovascular therapy in revascularization of the leg is established but not clearly",OpenAlex,0,0,2,0,0,1,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,none,15.0

Chitosan-based hydrogels are considered as ideal materials for enhancing wound healing owing to their biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, antimicrobial, biologically adhesive, biological activity and hemostatic effects. Chitosan-based hydrogels have been demonstrated to promote wound healing at different wound healing stages, and also can alleviate the factors against wound healing (such as excessive inflammatory and chronic wound infection). The unique biological properties of a chitosan-based hydrogel enable it to serve as both a wound dressing and as a drug delivery system (DDS) to deliver antibacterial agents, growth factors, stem cells and so on, which could further accelerate wound healing. For various kinds of wounds, chitosan-based hydrogels are able to promote the effectiveness of wound healing by modifying or combining with other polymers, and carrying different types of active substances.

Technologic innovations to reduce the risk for these infections are needed. Objective: To determine 1) the efficacy of a novel antiseptic catheter in preventing central venous catheter-related infection, 2) patient tolerance of this catheter, and 3) the sources of bloodstream infection originating from noncuffed, multilumen central venous catheters. Design: Randomized, controlled clinical trial. Setting: Medical-surgical intensive care unit of a 450-bed university hospital. Participants: 158 adults scheduled to receive a central venous catheter; 403 catheters were studied. Intervention: Participants received either a standard triple-lumen polyurethane catheter or a catheter that was indistinguishable from the standard catheter and was impregnated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine. Measurements: Catheters were studied for colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection at removal; local and systemic effects of catheters were assessed. The origin of each catheter-associated bloodstream infection was sought by culturing all potential sources (skin, catheter segments, hubs, and infusate) and confirmed by restriction-fragment DNA subtyping. Results: Antiseptic catheters were less likely to be colonized at removal than control catheters (13.5 compared with 24.1 colonized catheters per 100 catheters; relative risk, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.89]; P = 0.005) and were nearly fivefold less likely to produce bloodstream infection (1.0 compared with 4.7 infections per 100 catheters; 1.6 compared with 7.6 infections per 1000 catheter-days; relative risk, 0.21 [CI, 0.03 to 0.95]; P = 0.03). In the control group, 8 catheter-related bloodstream infections were caused by Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, or Candida species; no infections with these organisms occurred in the antiseptic catheter group [P = 0.003]. No adverse effects from the antiseptic catheter were seen, and none of the 122 isolates obtained from infected catheters in either group showed in vitro resistance to chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine. Cost-benefit analysis indicated that the antiseptic catheter should prove cost-beneficial if an institution's rate of catheter-related bacteremia with noncuffed central venous catheters is at least 3 infections per 1000 catheter-days). Conclusions: The chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine catheter is well tolerated, reduces the incidence of catheter-related infection, extends the time that noncuffed central venous catheters can be safely left in place for the short term, and should allow cost savings.",OpenAlex,0,0,8,9,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,antimicrobial,24.0

,10.1002/pat.1625,A review on wound dressings with an emphasis on electrospun nanofibrous polymeric bandages,Polymers for Advanced Technologies,2009.0,"Abstract Wound dressings have experienced continuous and significant changes since the ancient times. The development starts with the use of natural materials to simply cover the wounds to the materials of the present time that could be specially made to exhibit various extraordinary functions. The modern bandage materials made of electrospun biopolymers contain various active compounds that are beneficial to the healing of wounds. These materials are fibrous in nature, with the size of fibers segments ranging from tens of nanometers to micrometers. With the right choices of biopolymers used for these fibrous materials, they could enhance the healing of wounds significantly compared with the conventional fibrous dressing materials, such as gauze. These bandages could be made such that they contain bioactive ingredients, such as antimicrobial, antibacterial, and anti‐inflammatory agents, which could be released to the wounds enhancing their healing. In an active wound dressing (AWD), the main purpose is to control the biochemical states of a wound in order to aid its healing process. This review provides an overview of different types of wounds, effective parameters in wound healing and different types of wound dressing materials with a special emphasis paid to those prepared by electrospinning.

The antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive Acinetobacter baumannii (BM4454), using a broth culture method. The rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. All five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter species, Proteus species and E. coli. The spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. Acticoat and Contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii.

,10.1086/644732,Topical Antimicrobial Therapy for Treating Chronic Wounds,Clinical Infectious Diseases,2009.0,"Various agents have been applied topically to treat infected wounds for millennia, but their proper role remains unclear. Topical therapy affords many potential advantages but also has disadvantages. Opinions differ on which clinical signs define wound infection and on whether quantitative microbiological studies are useful. Clinically infected wounds usually require systemic antibiotic therapy, whereas clinically uninfected wounds that are healing as expected do not require antimicrobials. There is controversy over how to treat poorly healing wounds with ""secondary"" signs suggesting infection; these may benefit from topical antimicrobial agents. Some evidence supports using topical agents for malodorous or burn wounds. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews suggest there are few proven indications for topical antimicrobials. Use of a newer, relatively nontoxic antiseptic (eg, cadexomer iodine or silver dressings) is preferable to use of topical antibiotics, especially agents that are available for systemic use. We provide clinically relevant information on currently available topical antimicrobial agents. Perhaps the most deceptively simple of all therapeutic procedures is the treatment of cutaneous infection with topical medication. Despite the unique accessibility of the skin to scientific investigation, it has for too long been the playground of crude empiricism. —Professor Sydney Selwyn, 1981[1]",OpenAlex,0,0,5,5,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,antimicrobial,17.5

They traditionally provide a moist wound environment, but this property has been extended through simple to complex, active dressings which can handle excessive exudate, aid in debridement, and promote disorganised, stalled healing. The control of infection remains a major challenge. Inappropriate antibiotic use risks allergy, toxicity and most importantly resistance, which is much reduced by the use of topical antiseptics (such as povidone iodine and chlorhexidine). The definition of what is an antimicrobial and the recognition of infection has proven difficult. Although silver has been recognised for centuries to inhibit infection its use in wound care is relatively recent. Evidence of the efficacy of the growing number of silver dressings in clinical trials, judged by the criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration, is lacking, but there are good indications for the use of silver dressings, to remove or reduce an increasing bioburden in burns and open wounds healing by secondary intention, or to act as a barrier against cross contamination of resistant organisms such as MRSA. More laboratory, and clinical data in particular, are needed to prove the value of the many silver dressings which are now available.

Microbial biofilms are implicated in both the infection of wounds and failure of those wounds to heal. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of published papers detailing biofilms in wounds, the effect they have on infection and wound healing, and detailing methods employed for their detection. The studies highlighted within this paper provide evidence that biofilms reside within the chronic wound and represent an important mechanism underlying the observed, delayed healing and infection. The reasons for this include both protease activity and immunological suppression. Furthermore, a lack of responsiveness to an array of antimicrobial agents has been due to the biofilms’ ability to inherently resist antimicrobial agents.

In this study, silver nanoparticles are evaluated to elucidate their mode of antiviral action against HIV-1 using a panel of different in vitro assays. Our data suggest that silver nanoparticles exert anti-HIV activity at an early stage of viral replication, most likely as a virucidal agent or as an inhibitor of viral entry. Silver nanoparticles bind to gp120 in a manner that prevents CD4-dependent virion binding, fusion, and infectivity, acting as an effective virucidal agent against cell-free virus (laboratory strains, clinical isolates, T and M tropic strains, and resistant strains) and cell-associated virus. Besides, silver nanoparticles inhibit post-entry stages of the HIV-1 life cycle.

Method: Real-life evaluations of challenging wounds managed previously with cadexomer iodine (CI) dressings followed by switching to NGAD were evaluated alongside electron, confocal and light microscopy images from a challenging, in vitro, exuding chronic wound model. Clinical case studies on the use of CI and NGAD dressings are presented to further explore the real-life evidence and in vitro findings. Results: We assessed 13 non-healing wounds that had been managed with protocols including CI dressings. After a median of four weeks, switching to the NGAD as primary dressing resulted in improvements in nine wounds and healing in two wounds, with associated improvements in wound bed appearance, while dressing usage was the same as or lower than before. The NGAD was observed to prevent the development of Staphylococcus aureus— Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm over three days, in contrast to the CI dressing, which appeared to support biofilm development once the active antimicrobial was exhausted from its carrier material. Clinical case studies exhibited this exhaustion as ‘whiting out’ of the dressing, with wound biofilm observed from samples taken following dressing use. Positive wound and patient outcomes were observed in two cases following the switch from a CI primary dressing to the NGAD, in highly exuding and infected wounds.

,,DEVELOPMENT OF A NEXT-GENERATION ANTIMICROBIAL WOUND DRESSING.,PubMed,2016.0,"Delayed wound healing due to infection is a burden on healthcare systems, and the patient and caregiver alike. An emerging factor in infection and delayed healing is the presence development of biofilm in wounds. Biofilm is communities of microorganisms, protected by an extracellular matrix of slime in the wound, which can tolerate host defences and applied antimicrobials such as antibiotics or antimicrobial dressings. A growing evidence base exists suggesting that biofilm exists in a majority of chronic wounds, and can be a precursor to infection while causing delayed healing itself. In vivo models have demonstrated that the inflammatory, granulation and epithelialization processes of normal wound healing are impaired by biofilm presence. The challenge in the development of a new antimicrobial wound dressing was to make standard antimicrobial agents more effective against biofilm, and this was answered following extensive biofilm research and testing. A combination of metal chelator, surfactant and pH control displayed highly synergistic anti-biofilm action with 1.2% ionic silver in a carboxymethylcellulose dressing. Its effectiveness was challenged and proven in complex in vitro and in vivo wound biofilm models, followed by clinical safety and performance demonstrations in a 42-patient study and 113 clinical evaluations. Post-market surveillance was conducted on the commercially available dressing, and in a 112-case evaluation, the dressing was shown to effectively manage exudate and suspected biofilm while shifting difficult-to-heal wounds onto healing trajectories, after an average of 4 weeks of new dressing use in otherwise standard wound care protocols. This was accompanied by a low frequency of dressing related adverse events. In a second evaluation, clinical signs of infection and wound dimension data, before and after the evaluations, were also available. Following an average of 5.4 weeks of dressing use, all signs of clinical infection were reduced, from an average frequency of 36% to 21%. An average of 62% wound size reduction was achieved, with 90% of wounds reducing in size and 10 wounds healing completely. The new clinical evidence for this next-generation antimicrobial wound dressing suggests it is safe and effective at managing exudate, infection and biofilm, while it can shift established, stubborn wounds onto healing trajectories. The scientific rationale for this new dressing technology is supported by in vitro and in vivo evidence, so now further comparative, randomized and outcome-based clinical studies are required to fully understand the clinical and economic benefits this new dressing technology can bring.",OpenAlex,0,0,7,6,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,antimicrobial,20.5

Despite recent advances in wound care products, traditional therapies based on natural origin compounds, such as plant extracts, honey, and larvae, are interesting alternatives. These therapies offer new possibilities for the treatment of skin diseases, enhancing the access to the healthcare, and allowing overcoming some limitations associated to the modern products and therapies, such as the high costs, the long manufacturing times, and the increase in the bacterial resistance. This article gives a general overview about the recent advances in traditional therapies for skin wound healing, focusing on the therapeutic activity, action mechanisms, and clinical trials of the most commonly used natural compounds. New insights in the combination of traditional products with modern treatments and future challenges in the field are also highlighted. Recent Advances: Natural compounds have been used in skin wound care for many years due to their therapeutic activities, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and cell-stimulating properties. The clinical efficacy of these compounds has been investigated through in vitro and in vivo trials using both animal models and humans. Besides the important progress regarding the development of novel extraction methods, purification procedures, quality control assessment, and treatment protocols, the exact mechanisms of action, side effects, and safety of these compounds need further research. Critical Issues: The repair of skin lesions is one of the most complex biological processes in humans, occurring throughout an orchestrated cascade of overlapping biochemical and cellular events. To stimulate the regeneration process and prevent the wound to fail the healing, traditional therapies and natural products have been used with promising results. Although these products are in general less expensive than the modern treatments, they can be sensitive to the geographic location and season, and exhibit batch-to-batch variation, which can lead to unexpected allergic reactions, side effects, and contradictory clinical results. Future Directions: The scientific evidence for the use of traditional therapies in wound healing indicates beneficial effects in the treatment of different lesions. However, specific challenges remain unsolved. To extend the efficacy and the usage of natural substances in wound care, multidisciplinary efforts are necessary to prove the safety of these products, investigate their side effects, and develop standard controlled trials. The development of good manufacturing practices and regulatory legislation also assume a pivotal role in order to improve the use of traditional therapies by the clinicians and to promote their integration into the national health system.

The WHO and CDC have expressed serious concern regarding the continued increase in the development of multidrug resistance among bacteria. Therefore, the antibiotic resistance crisis is one of the most pressing issues in global public health. Associated with the rise in antibiotic resistance is the lack of new antimicrobials. This has triggered initiatives worldwide to develop novel and more effective antimicrobial compounds as well as to develop novel delivery and targeting strategies. Bacteria have developed many ways by which they become resistant to antimicrobials. Among those are enzyme inactivation, decreased cell permeability, target protection, target overproduction, altered target site/enzyme, increased efflux due to over-expression of efflux pumps, among others. Other more complex phenotypes, such as biofilm formation and quorum sensing do not appear as a result of the exposure of bacteria to antibiotics although, it is known that biofilm formation can be induced by antibiotics. These phenotypes are related to tolerance to antibiotics in bacteria. Different strategies, such as the use of nanostructured materials, are being developed to overcome these and other types of resistance. Nanostructured materials can be used to convey antimicrobials, to assist in the delivery of novel drugs or ultimately, possess antimicrobial activity by themselves. Additionally, nanoparticles (e.g., metallic, organic, carbon nanotubes, etc.) may circumvent drug resistance mechanisms in bacteria and, associated with their antimicrobial potential, inhibit biofilm formation or other important processes. Other strategies, including the combined use of plant-based antimicrobials and nanoparticles to overcome toxicity issues, are also being investigated. Coupling nanoparticles and natural-based antimicrobials (or other repurposed compounds) to inhibit the activity of bacterial efflux pumps; formation of biofilms; interference of quorum sensing; and possibly plasmid curing, are just some of the strategies to combat multidrug resistant bacteria. However, the use of nanoparticles still presents a challenge to therapy and much more research is needed in order to overcome this.

There are considerable variations in the structure, composition, and silver content of these new preparations. In the present study, we examined five commercially available silver‐based dressings (Acticoat™, Aquacel ® Ag, Contreet ® Foam, PolyMem ® Silver, Urgotul ® SSD). We assessed their cytotoxicity in a monolayer cell culture, a tissue explant culture model, and a mouse excisional wound model. The results showed that Acticoat™, Aquacel ® Ag, and Contreet ® Foam, when pretreated with specific solutes, were likely to produce the most significant cytotoxic effects on both cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts, while PolyMem ® Silver and Urgotul ® SSD demonstrated the least cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity correlated with the silver released from the dressings as measured by silver concentration in the culture medium. In the tissue explant culture model, in which the epidermal cell proliferation was evaluated, all silver dressings resulted in a significant delay of reepithelialization. In the mouse excisional wound model, Acticoat™ and Contreet ® Foam indicated a strong inhibition of wound reepithelialization on the postwounding‐day 7.

Tissue: a major advance has been the recognition of the value of repetitive and maintenance debridement and wound cleansing, both in time‐honoured and novel methods (notably using NPWT and hydrosurgery). Infection/inflammation: clinical recognition of infection (and non infective causes of persisting inflammation) is critical. The concept of a bacterial continuum through contamination, colonisation and infection is now widely accepted, together with the understanding of biofilm presence. There has been a return to topical antiseptics to control bioburden in wounds, emphasised by the awareness of increasing antibiotic resistance. Moisture: the relevance of excessive or insufficient wound exudate and its molecular components has led to the development and use of a wide range of dressings to regulate moisture balance, and to protect peri‐wound skin, and optimise healing.

Silver‐containing dressings offer one method for controlling this polymicrobial wound bioburden, and research efforts are currently ongoing to determine their efficacy against aerobic, anaerobic, and antibiotic‐resistant microorganisms. The current study aimed to determine the antimicrobial activity of a new silver‐containing Hydrofiber ® dressing (AQUACEL ® Ag) on both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, using the zone‐of‐inhibition method. This method provides a measure of the ability of the dressing to make available a sufficient concentration of silver to have an antimicrobial effect.

It is the purpose of the guideline to bring the current knowledge of biofilm diagnosis and therapy to the attention of clinical microbiologists and infectious disease specialists. Selected hallmark biofilm infections in tissues (e.g. cystic fibrosis with chronic lung infection, patients with chronic wound infections) or associated with devices (e.g. orthopaedic alloplastic devices, endotracheal tubes, intravenous catheters, indwelling urinary catheters, tissue fillers) are the main focus of the guideline, but experience gained from the biofilm infections included in the guideline may inspire similar work in other biofilm infections. The clinical and laboratory parameters for diagnosing biofilm infections are outlined based on the patient's history, signs and symptoms, microscopic findings, culture-based or culture-independent diagnostic techniques and specific immune responses to identify microorganisms known to cause biofilm infections. First, recommendations are given for the collection of appropriate clinical samples, for reliable methods to specifically detect biofilms, for the evaluation of antibody responses to biofilms, for antibiotic susceptibility testing and for improvement of laboratory reports of biofilm findings in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

Many interventions, including new medications and technologies, are being used to help achieve significant wound healing and to eliminate infections. Therefore, to find an intervention that has both therapeutic effect on the healing process and the ability to kill microbes is of great value. Honey is a natural product that has been recently introduced in modern medical practice. Honey's antibacterial properties and its effects on wound healing have been thoroughly investigated. Laboratory studies and clinical trials have shown that honey is an effective broad-spectrum antibacterial agent. This paper reviews data that support the effectiveness of natural honey in wound healing and its ability to sterilize infected wounds. Studies on the therapeutic effects of honey collected in different geographical areas on skin wounds, skin and gastric ulcers, and burns are reviewed and mechanisms of action are discussed. (Ulcers and burns are included as an example of challenging wounds.) The data show that the wound healing properties of honey include stimulation of tissue growth, enhanced epithelialization, and minimized scar formation. These effects are ascribed to honey's acidity, hydrogen peroxide content, osmotic effect, nutritional and antioxidant contents, stimulation of immunity, and to unidentified compounds. Prostaglandins and nitric oxide play a major role in inflammation, microbial killing, and the healing process. Honey was found to lower prostaglandin levels and elevate nitric oxide end products. These properties might help to explain some biological and therapeutic properties of honey, particularly as an antibacterial agent or wound healer. The data presented here demonstrate that honeys from different geographical areas have considerable therapeutic effects on chronic wounds, ulcers, and burns.

,10.4103/ijem.ijem_481_17,Choices and challenges of antibiotics therapy in diabetic foot infection,Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism,2017.0,"Diabetic foot can be defined as any foot pathology that results directly from diabetes mellitus or its long-term complications.[1] This is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus requiring in hospitalization for not only leading to significant morbidity an expensive investigations and costly treatment but also for progression to limb-threatening and life-threatening diabetic foot infection. The two main causes of diabetic foot wounds are neuropathy and ischemia.[2] Among the diabetic patients, the prevalence of foot ulcer ranged from 12% to 25%.[3] Diabetic foot wounds are prone to get infected which spread through soft tissue and the bone as a result of impaired defense mechanisms and delayed process of wound healing[4] advancing the wound age. A study from South India reported the prevalence of infection among patients with diabetic foot up to 11%.[5] Similar studies are not many from the vast population of patients with diabetes mellitus in our country and the one by Jain and Barman published in the current issue of Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism is most welcome addition to published data of the region.[6] Interestingly, the size of the problem of diabetic foot infection is not similar in different geographical regions of India, and the major determinants of data variability are patients' access to or availability of diabetic foot care facilities in the particular region.[7] The existing health-care facilities in the developing part of the world do not focus diabetic foot care adequately as their resources are drained to detection and control measures of hyperglycemia of diabetic patients. The challenges are numerous and unique to developing countries for the diabetic foot management. Large number of patients with diabetic foot ulcer has advanced grades of diabetic foot ulcers not amenable to available treatment in resource constraint health-care system. The uniqueness also lies in the presentation of diabetic foot infection in patients from different regions with diabetic foot that has been briefly referred to in the following paragraphs. Microbial infection changes characteristics due to multiple attempts of inappropriate antibiotics therapy (type, doses and duration) initiated by primary care physicians. It is needless to reiterate that diabetic foot care mandates involvement of patients and caregiver together with education and training of their performance as an example of ""shared care."" Sporadic information is available regarding the prevalence and characteristics of microbial infection of diabetic foot through some of the published studies conducted in our country.[89] In a prospective study[8] conducted during 2009, on 62 diabetic patients highlighted some of the characteristics of diabetic foot infection. Among the study participants, 35% patients had polymicrobial infection and 21% had sterile culture by standard techniques. Gram-negative outnumbered Gram-positive isolates by almost two times. Escherichia coli were the most common among the Gram-negative isolates. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was only 44.7% in this study while it was 100% in a study from Iran.[10] In the article published by Jain and Barman, in this issue of journal has reported dominance of Staphylococcus infection over Gram-negative E. coli with MRSA around 41% in diabetic foot ulcer.[6] The variability in the characteristics of diabetic foot infection has many issues Factors that render it to wound infection such as age of the wound, poor wound hygiene, and host immunity Polymicrobial nature of wound infection due to chronicity of the nonhealing ulcer Development of MRSA and other microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents Pretreatment with antimicrobial agents on empirical basis paving way to emergence of antimicrobial resistance or transforming the wound culture sterile. These challenges are not amenable to simple measures. Microbial study of diabetic foot wound with identification of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents would help in choosing the appropriate antibiotics but the absence of isolate from the infected would site or polymicrobial nature of infection remains an insurmountable challenge. The molecular techniques that help identify the isolate from the wound site otherwise sterile on routine evaluation are a sure way but inaccessible to most of the clinics dedicated to diabetic foot care. My group has published a paper using the molecular technique to identify the diversity and colonization of microbial agents undetected by standard culture techniques in the tissue from diabetic foot ulcers.[11] This would be an ideal measure yet to emerge a tool to strengthen the diabetic foot clinic for the handling of diabetic foot infection in cost-effective manner. Anaerobic infection of diabetic foot infection had been held as a challenge for successful eradication of infection but surprisingly enough our own study showed that anaerobic infection of diabetic foot did not require specific intervention.[12] Anaerobes do not pose risk with the healing stages of the wound given that aerobic infection has been eradicated in an efficient manner. In the paper published by Jain and Barman,[6] in the current issue of this journal has also covered points of selection of antibiotics for diabetic foot infection and this has been in the line of the earlier studies showing the predominance of Gram-negative E. coli infection in diabetic foot infection of longer duration. Piperacillin and tazobactam are a good parenteral antibiotic followed by newer generation cephalosporins. Quinolones, aminoglycosides, and macrolides are the next choices of antibiotics. Tigecycline, vancomycin, and teicoplanin are to be reserved for the limb- and life-threatening infection as we would not have further choices consequence to early use of these agents. Pseudomonas infection is occasional in the diabetic foot wound particularly in those having burn injury of the foot. Aminoglycosides and the tigecycline might eradicate Pseudomonas if the newer generation cephalosporins have not shown promise in the containment of the infection. Choice of antibiotics therapy, therefore, depends on the severity of infection, involvement of bone, previous antibiotics therapy, the type of microorganism in wound isolate, patient's comorbid conditions, cost, and safety profile of the agents. It should be reflex phenomena in the mind of the treating physicians to adhere to the above viewpoint which has been very elegantly outlined in the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) guidelines for the diabetic foot infection.[13] Evaluation of osteomyelitis is essential to decide the duration of",OpenAlex,0,0,35,4,0,1,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,antimicrobial,60.5

In the food industry, alginate has been used to coat fruits and vegetables, as a microbial and viral protection product, and as a gelling, thickening, stabilizing or emulsifying agent. Its biocompatibility, biodegradability, nontoxicity and the possibility of it being used in quantum satis doses prompted scientists to explore new properties for alginate usage. Thus, the use of alginate has been expanded so as to be directed towards the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries, where studies have shown that it can be used successfully as biomaterial for wound, hydrogel, and aerogel dressings, among others. Furthermore, the ability to encapsulate natural substances has led to the possibility of using alginate as a drug coating and drug delivery agent, including the encapsulation of probiotics. This is important considering the fact that, until recently, encapsulation and coating agents used in the pharmaceutical industry were limited to the use of lactose, a potentially allergenic agent or gelatin. Obtained at a relatively low cost from marine brown algae, this hydrocolloid can also be used as a potential tool in the management of diabetes, not only as an insulin delivery agent but also due to its ability to improve insulin resistance, attenuate chronic inflammation and decrease oxidative stress.

One of the most common side effects of radiation is acute skin reaction (radiation dermatitis) that ranges from a mild rash to severe ulceration. Approximately 85% of patients treated with radiation therapy will experience a moderate-to-severe skin reaction. Acute radiation-induced skin reactions often lead to itching and pain, delays in treatment, and diminished aesthetic appearance-and subsequently to a decrease in quality of life. Surveys have demonstrated that a wide variety of topical, oral, and intravenous agents are used to prevent or to treat radiation-induced skin reactions. We conducted a literature review to identify trials that investigated products for the prophylaxis and management of acute radiation dermatitis. Thirty-nine studies met the pre-defined criteria, with thirty-three being categorized as prophylactic trials and six as management trials.For objective evaluation of skin reactions, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria and the U.S. National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria were the most commonly used tools (65% of the studies). Topical corticosteroid agents were found to significantly reduce the severity of skin reactions; however, the trials of corticosteroids evaluated various agents, and no clear indication about a preferred corticosteroid has emerged. Amifostine and oral enzymes were somewhat effective in preventing radiation-induced skin reactions in phase II and phase III trials respectively; further large randomized controlled trials should be undertaken to better investigate those products. Biafine cream (Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals, Titusville, NJ, U.S.A.) was found not to be superior to standard regimes in the prevention of radiation-induced skin reactions (n = 6).In conclusion, the evidence is insufficient to support the use of a particular agent for the prevention and management of acute radiation-induced skin reactions. Future trials should focus on comparing agents and approaches that, in phase I and II trials, suggest efficacy. These future phase III randomized controlled trials must clearly distinguish between preventive and management strategies for radiation-induced dermatitis.

If neglected it can progress from contamination to colonization and local infection through to systemic infection, sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and it can be life-threatening. Infection in chronic wounds is not as easy to define as in acute wounds, and is complicated by the presence of biofilms. There is, as yet, no diagnostic for biofilm presence, but it contributes to excessive inflammation – through excessive and prolonged stimulation of nitric oxide, inflammatory cytokines and free radicals – and activation of immune complexes and complement, leading to a delay in healing. Control of biofilm is a key part of chronic wound management. Maintenance debridement and use of topical antimicrobials (antiseptics) are more effective than antibiotics, which should be reserved for treating spreading local and systemic infection. The continuing rise of antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics should lead us to reserve their use for these indications, as no new effective antibiotics are in the research pipeline. Antiseptics are effective through many mechanisms of action, unlike antibiotics, which makes the development of resistance to them unlikely. There is little evidence to support the theoretical risk that antiseptics select resistant pathogens.

However, a strict indication must be set for the application of these agents. An infected or critically colonized wound must be treated antiseptically. In addition, systemic antibiotic therapy is required in case the infection spreads. If applied preventively, the Wounds-at-Risk Score allows an assessment of the risk for infection and thus appropriateness of the indication. The content of this updated consensus recommendation still largely consists of discussing properties of octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT), polihexanide, and iodophores. The evaluations of hypochlorite, taurolidine, and silver ions have been updated. For critically colonized and infected chronic wounds as well as for burns, polihexanide is classified as the active agent of choice. The combination 0.1% OCT/phenoxyethanol (PE) solution is suitable for acute, contaminated, and traumatic wounds, including MRSA-colonized wounds due to its deep action. For chronic wounds, preparations with 0.05% OCT are preferable. For bite, stab/puncture, and gunshot wounds, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-iodine is the first choice, while polihexanide and hypochlorite are superior to PVP-iodine for the treatment of contaminated acute and chronic wounds. For the decolonization of wounds colonized or infected with MDROs, the combination of OCT/PE is preferred. For peritoneal rinsing or rinsing of other cavities with a lack of drainage potential as well as the risk of central nervous system exposure, hypochlorite is the superior active agent. Silver-sulfadiazine is classified as dispensable, while dyes, organic mercury compounds, and hydrogen peroxide alone are classified as obsolete.

We included relevant trials involving patients with burn. Trials were eligible if they evaluated propranolol and compared to usual care or placebo. We conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model.ResultsA total of 2114 patients were included from 14 RCTs. Beta-blocker-treated patients had decreased heart rates (WMD = -14.73, 95% CIs = [-19.14, -10.32]), mean arterial pressure (WMD = -2.76, 95% CIs = [-3.81, -1.70]), rate pressure product (WMD = -1.13, 95% CIs = [-1.56, -0.71]), reduced time for wound healing (WMD = -5.08, 95% CIs [-8.97, -1.18]), and lower resting energy expenditure (WMD = -168.83, 95% CIs [-232.03, -105.63]). However, use of beta-blockers did not reduce mortality rate (WMD = 0.98, 95% CIs [0.68, 1.41]), incidence of sepsis (RR = 0.82, 95% CIs = [0.50, 1.35]), or length of stay in hospital (WMD = -1.50, 95% CIs [-4.76, 1.77]) compared with placebo.ConclusionOur findings indicate that the administration of propranolol to burned patients does not contribute to increased mortality rates, reduced length of hospital stays, or heightened sepsis occurrence. It demonstrates a protective effect on heart function by reducing heart rate, resting energy expenditure, rate pressure product, and wound healing. More randomized-controlled and multi-center studies are needed to effectively establish the use of beta antagonists in burn patients.",PubMed,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0

A comprehensive synthesis of the available evidence on interventions for TIC is needed. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of blood component products and tranexamic acid administrations for severe trauma patients with TIC. We included randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials. We included studies with patients who required transfusion with any coagulopathy associated with trauma and a detailed definition. The intervention was administration of blood component products and tranexamic acid. The primary outcome of the study was all-cause mortality and transfusion quantity. Results: Four randomized controlled trials and seven observational studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. In this study, fibrinogen concentrate (FC), prothrombin coagulation cofactor (PCC), and Combination administrations of FC and PCC (FC + PCC) administration did not significantly reduce mortality rates. FC, PCC, and FC + PCC administrations significantly reduced RBC transfusions after admission. In addition, PCC administration reduced FFP transfusions during hospital admission. The incidence of thrombotic events was not significantly higher in the FC + PCC, PCC, and rFVIIa groups. Although statistically nonsignificant, multiple organ failure was lower in the FC and FC + PCC groups. Conclusions: FC and PCC administrations did not significantly reduce mortality. However, FC, PCC, and FC + PCC reduced transfusion rates and complications in patients with coagulopathy-associated trauma. However, the definition of TIC is quite heterogeneous. Thus, the definition of TIC should be defined universally. Furthermore, because of the lack of high certainty of evidence, further well-constructed trials are warranted to investigate the efficacy of blood component products, specifically FC and PCC supplementation for TIC.",PubMed,0,1,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,True,,,,,A,High,,hemorrhage,none,11.5

This high mortality is thought to be associated with persistent immunosuppression. Knowledge about the pathophysiology leading to this state remains fragmented. Immunosuppressive cytokines play an essential role in mediating and upholding immunosuppression in these patients. Specifically, the cytokines Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) and Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are reported to have potent immunosuppressive capacities.

If the blood supply has been restored, these arterial ulcers can heal following principles of good wound-care. Dressings and topical agents make up a part of good wound-care for arterial ulcers, but there are many products available, and it is unclear what impact these have on ulcer healing.

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint, and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialized Registry on June 12, 2018; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2018, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE (1946-2018); and Embase (1980-2018). To identify RCTs, we combined a subject-specific search strategy with a sensitivity-maximizing version of the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy. Included were RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compare NPWT with other treatments or no treatment following primary hip and knee replacements. We excluded trials that were focused on patients undergoing revision hip or knee replacements or who had pathological bone disease or periprosthetic fractures. Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria and are included in this review, making a total of 382 patients with primary total hip/knee replacements. Included trials were of varying quality, with little consistency in control groups or outcome measures; therefore, a meta-analysis could not be performed. Overall, three RCTs reported no significant differences in primary outcomes after NPWT, in comparison to standard or conventional wound care. One trial reported significant reduction in wound seroma size in patients undergoing primary hip replacements after NPWT, compared to standard dressings (NPWT, 1.97 vs. 5.08 mL [p = 0.021]; n = 19). Finally, one trial that compared NPWT with standard dressings following primary hip/knee replacements (n = 209) reported statistically significant differences that favored NPWT for overall reduction in length of hospital stay (mean difference, 0.9 d, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.2-2.5; p = 0.07), number of dressing changes (mean difference, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.8-2.5; p = 0.002), and a fourfold reduction in reported postoperative surgical wound complications (8.4% vs. 2.0%; p = 0.06). Cost-effectiveness quality adjusted life years showed greater savings for higher-risk patients (body mass index ≥ 35; ASA ≥ 3). We find no justification for applying NPWT to all postoperative wounds after routine total hip and knee replacement; however, NPWT may benefit selected patients who are at high risk for wound complications.",PubMed,0,0,0,0,0,1,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,12.0

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of skin substitutes on ulcer healing and limb salvage in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Randomized clinical trials were searched and assessed following the methodology of The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 17 trials, totaling 1655 randomized participants. Risk of bias was variable among included trials. Thirteen trials compared the skin substitutes with standard care. The pooled results showed that that skin substitutes can, in addition to standard care, increase the likelihood of achieving complete ulcer closure compared with standard care alone after 6-16 weeks (risk ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-1.85). Four of the included trials compared two types of skin substitutes but no particular product showed a superior effect over another. Two trials reported on total incidence of lower limb amputations. Pooling the results of these two trials yielded a statistically significantly lower amputation rate among patients treated with skin substitutes (risk ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.81), although the absolute risk difference was small (-0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.01). This systematic review provides evidence that skin substitutes can, in addition to standard care, increase the likelihood of achieving complete ulcer closure compared with standard care alone in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. However, effectiveness on the long term, including lower limb salvage and recurrence, is currently lacking and cost-effectiveness is unclear.",PubMed,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,9.0

A diabetic person has a 25% lifetime risk of developing a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), leading to limb amputation in up to one in six DFU patients. Low-level light therapy (LLLT) uses low-power lasers or light-emitting diodes to alter cellular function and molecular pathways, and may be a promising treatment for DFU. The goal of this systematic review is to examine whether the clinical use of LLLT is effective in the healing of DFU at 12 and 20 weeks in comparison with the standard of care, and to provide evidence-based recommendation and future clinical guidelines for the treatment of DFU using LLLT. On September 30, 2015, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases using the following terms: ""diabetic foot"" AND ""low level light therapy,"" OR ""light emitting diode,"" OR ""phototherapy,"" OR ""laser."" The relevant articles that met the following criteria were selected for inclusion: randomized control trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of LLLT for treatment of DFU. Four RCTs involving 131 participants were suitable for inclusion based upon our criteria. The clinical trials used sham irriadiation, low dose, or nontherapeutic LLLT as placebo or control in comparison to LLLT. The endpoints included ulcer size and time to complete healing with follow-up ranging from 2 to 16 weeks. Each article was assigned a level of evidence (LOE) and graded according to the Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence Grades of Recommendation criteria. Limitations of reviewed RCTs include a small sample size (N < 100), unclear allocation concealment, lack of screening phase to exclude rapid healers, unclear inclusion/exclusion criteria, short (<30 days) follow-up period, and unclear treatment settings (wavelength and treatment time). However, all reviewed RCTs demonstrated therapeutic outcomes with no adverse events using LLLT for treatment of DFU. This systematic review reports that LLLT has significant potential to become a portable, minimally invasive, easy-to-use, and cost effective modality for treatment of DFU. To enthusiastically recommend LLLT for treatment of DFU, additional studies with comparable laser parameters, screening period to exclude rapid healers, larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are required. We envision future stringent RCTs may validate LLLT for treatment of DFU.

Artificial airways are utilised to facilitate ventilation and the endotracheal tube (ETT) is most commonly used for this purpose. The ETT must be stabilised to optimise ventilation and avoid displacement or unplanned extubation. Tube movement is a major factor in causing airway trauma. A destabilised tube can cause fatal complications. A systematic review was conducted to identify and analyse the best available evidence on ETT stabilisation to determine which stabilisation method resulted in reduced tube displacement and the least amount of unplanned or accidental extubations. The types of stabilisations included one or a combination of the following methods: twill or cotton tape, adhesive tape, gauze, or a manufactured device. All relevant randomised controlled and quasi-experimental studies of ETT stabilisation practices, identified through electronic and hand searching, were assessed for inclusion in the study. One published randomised controlled trial and six published quasi-experimental studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were retrieved. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Results of the systematic review showed that no single method of ETT stabilisation could be identified as superior for minimising tube displacement and unplanned or accidental extubations.

This Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-compliant review focuses on the efficacy of cellular, acellular and matrix-like products (CAMPs) in the management of diabetic foot ulcers based on published randomized control trials (RCTs).


RECENT ADVANCES
While CAMPs have been incorporated into the clinical algorithm for chronic wounds, evidence is lacking to comparatively evaluate the efficacy of these products.


CRITICAL ISSUES
Level 1 RCT studies are the gold standard to evaluate efficacy of different treatment approaches, however, due to differences in surgical techniques, patient demographics and compliance, standard of care outcomes in the wound care space can vary significantly between different randomized controlled trials, making it difficult to compare them against each other.


FUTURE DIRECTIONS
To mitigate variability between different RCTs, wound closure outcomes can be reported as risk ratios. This review of all currently published RCTs (with similar trial design) in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients and risk ratios, confirms that CAMPs adjunct to standard of care result in statistically superior wound closure outcome in diabetic foot ulcers, when compared to standard of care alone, with a Risk Ratio (RR) of 1.72 [1.56, 1.90], p< 0.00001. Enough evidence is still lacking to determine a statistical difference between broad categories of cellular/acellular and amniotic/non-amniotic CAMPs; and hence decision makers should consider published head-head comparative studies, real-world evidence and cost-effectiveness evidence between individual CAMPs to decide on which to use in practice.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0
,,Evidence for Healing Diabetic Foot Ulcers With Biologic Skin Substitutes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Annals of Plastic Surgery,2019.0,"BACKGROUND
Development of diabetic foot ulcers is a common complication of diabetes. Standard-of-care (SOC) therapy alone is often not sufficient to heal these wounds, resulting in application of adjuvant wound therapies including biologic skin substitutes. Although a variety of products exist, it has been difficult to formulate conclusions on their clinical efficacy. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of healing diabetic foot ulcers with biologic skin substitutes.


METHODS
A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Four electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE [Ovid], Cochrane CENTRAL [Ovid], and Web of Science) were searched from inception through February 27, 2019. Searches included keywords and subject headings pertaining to 3 main concepts: biologic skin substitutes, wound healing, and diabetic foot ulcers. Cochrane randomized controlled trial filters were used to narrow results. Data were extracted from 54 included articles, and risk-of-bias assessments were conducted by 2 independent reviewers. The primary objective was to calculate a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 12 weeks. Secondary objectives included a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 6 weeks and mean time to healing.


RESULTS
Twenty-five studies were identified that assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 12 weeks. We found that wounds treated with biologic dressings were 1.67 times more likely to heal by 12 weeks than those treated with SOC dressings (P < 0.00001). Five studies assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 6 weeks. Wounds treated with biologic dressings were 2.81 times more likely to heal by 6 weeks than those treated with SOC dressings (P = 0.0001). Descriptively, 29 of 31 studies that assessed time to healing favored biologic dressings over SOC dressings.


CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review provides supporting evidence that biologic skin substitutes are more effective than SOC dressings at healing diabetic foot ulcers by 12 weeks. Future studies must address the relative benefits of different skin substitutes as well as the long-term implications of these products and their financial considerations.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,9.0

,,Effects of home‐based chronic wound care training for patients and caregivers: A systematic review,International Wound Journal,2023.0,"We aimed to review and synthesise the evidence of the interventions of patients' and informal caregivers' engagement in managing chronic wounds at home. The research team used a systematic review methodology based on an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews (PRISMA) and recommendations from the Synthesis Without Meta‐analysis. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial of the Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Wanfang (Chinese), and CNKI database (Chinese) were searched from inception to May 2022. The following MESH terms were used: wound healing, pressure ulcer, leg ulcer, diabetic foot, skin ulcer, surgical wound, educational, patient education, counselling, self‐care, self‐management, social support, and family caregiver. Experimental studies involving participants with chronic wounds (not at risk of wounds) and their informal caregivers were screened. Data were extracted and the narrative was synthesised from the findings of included studies. By screening the above databases, 790 studies were retrieved, and 16 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were 6 RCTs and ten non‐RCTs. Outcomes of chronic wound management included patient indicators, wound indicators, and family/caregiver indicators. Home‐based interventions of patients or informal caregivers' engagement in managing chronic wounds at home may effectively improve patient outcomes and change wound care behaviour. What's more, educational/behavioural interventions were the primary type of intervention. Multiform integration of education and skills training on wound care and aetiology‐based treatment was delivered to patients and caregivers. Besides, there are no studies entirely targeting elderly patients. Home‐based chronic wound care training was important to patients with chronic wounds and their family caregivers, which may advance wound management outcomes. However, the findings of this systematic review were based on relatively small studies. We need more exploration of self and family‐oriented interventions in the future, especially for older people affected by chronic wounds.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,12.0
,,Clinical and cost efficacy of advanced wound care matrices in the treatment of venous leg ulcers: a systematic review.,Journal of wound care,2021.0,"BACKGROUND
Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are hard-to-heal, recurrent and challenging to treat. Advanced wound care matrices (AWCMs) have been developed to supplement conventional therapies. These costly AWCMs warrant careful comparison as healthcare expenditures are subjected to increasing scrutiny.


AIM
This study was designed to compare AWCMs in their ability to heal VLUs and their cost efficacy through a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).


METHOD
An organised search of Medline, Cochrane Library, Central and CINAHL databases identified RCTs that compared AWCMs to standard compression therapy in the healing of VLUs. Bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Eight studies analysing bilayered skin substitute (BSS) (Apligraf), dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) (Epifix), human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (HFDDS) (Dermagraft), extracellular wound matrix (ECM) (Oasis), advanced matrix (AM) (Talymed) and matrix wound dressing (MWD) (Promogran) met the inclusion criteria.


RESULTS
Four studies reported significant improvement over standard therapy: BSS, dHACM, ECM and AM. Incremental cost per additional successful treatment was determined for each trial, ranging from $2593 (MWD) to $210,800 (HFDDS).


CONCLUSION
Our consolidated analysis of eight major RCTs of AWCMs in the treatment of VLUs revealed a great variation in clinical and cost efficacy among these products. The included trials were inconsistent in methodology, and these limitations should be noted, but, in the absence of RCTs to compare these products, our systematic review may serve as a guide for practitioners who seek to optimise wound healing while considering cost efficacy.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,12.0

,,Therapeutic Indices of Topical Antiseptics in Wound Care: A Systematic Review,Advances in Skin & Wound Care,2024.0,"GENERAL PURPOSE To review the therapeutic indices of topical antiseptics for bacterial species commonly isolated from chronic wounds. TARGET AUDIENCE This continuing education activity is intended for physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses with an interest in skin and wound care. LEARNING OBJECTIVES/OUTCOMES After participating in this educational activity, the participant will: 1. Explain the mechanisms underlying chronic wound physiology and their implications for effective wound healing and management. 2. Evaluate the role of therapeutic index values for topical antiseptics in chronic wound management. 3. Apply evidence-based treatment strategies for chronic wound management. ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Chronic wounds place a heavy burden on healthcare systems and reduce patients’ activities of daily living. Increased bacterial bioburden (local infection, covert infection) impairs wound healing. With increased antimicrobial resistance, alternative antimicrobial strategies are important. OBJECTIVE To determine the topical antiseptic therapeutic index values for common wound bacterial species. The therapeutic index is a ratio comparing lowest concentration that causes mammalian cell cytotoxicity to the minimum bactericidal concentration; higher values indicate greater safety / clinical benefit. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from conception to June 2023. Common wound bacterial species and their in-vitro minimum bactericidal concentrations were compared to the minimum mammalian cell cytotoxicity concentration. STUDY SELECTION The authors identified 37 qualifying articles. DATA EXTRACTION Antiseptic, bacterial organism, mammalian cell type, minimum bactericidal concentration, and mammalian cell cytotoxicity concentration values. DATA SYNTHESIS The therapeutic indices for the topical antiseptics were generally low, with most ranging between 0.5 and 3.0. The highest therapeutic index values for Escherichia coli (5.49), Staphylococcus aureus (6.31) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.81) were achieved by hypochlorous acid. The highest therapeutic index value for methicillin resistant S aureus (12.1) was achieved by polyhexamethylene biguanide. CONCLUSIONS Antibiotic stewardship principles need to be applied to topical antiseptics due to some isolated topical antiseptic resistance and cross-resistance to oral antimicrobials. The choice of antiseptic should not be made solely based on therapeutic index values but individualized with the wound healing condition including covert infection.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,3,6,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,antimicrobial,infection,17.5
,,Human amniotic membrane products for patients with diabetic foot ulcers. do they help? a systematic review and meta-analysis,Journal of Foot and Ankle Research,2022.0,"Background Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most serious diabetic complications. DFU is an open wound that usually occurs in the foot sole due to poor blood glucose control, peripheral neuropathy, and poor circulation. The human amniotic allograft membrane is a biological wound dressing derived from the amniotic membrane. It contains amino acids, nutrients, cytokines, and growth factors that make the growth process easier. Objective To compare dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (DHACA) plus the standard of wound care (SOC) with the SOC alone. Methods We searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science till April 2021 using relevant keywords. All search results were screened for eligibility. We extracted the data from the included trials and pooled them as mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) using Review Manager software (ver. 5.4). Results The pooled effect estimate from 11 RCTs showed that DHACA was superior to SOC regarding the complete wound healing in both 6th and 12th week (RR = 3.78; 95% CI: [2.51, 5.70]; P  < 0.00001) and (RR = 2.00; 95% CI: [1.67, 2.39], P  < 0.00001 respectively). Also, the analysis favored the DHACA regarding the mean time to heal in the 12th-week (MD = -12.07, 95%CI: [-19.23, -4.91], P  = 0.001). The wound size reduction was better with DHACA (MD = 1.18, 95%CI: [-0,10, 2.26], P  = 0.03).

Recurrently, topical sucralfate is used to treat excoriations and burns. It is considered to enhance epidermal growth and tissue granulation, thus, alleviating patients' problems. This study evaluated topical sucralfate's feasibility, safety, and superiority after haemorrhoidectomy. We searched randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies in PubMed, Google Scholar, Europe PMC, and ClinicalTrials.gov until March 29th, 2022. We investigated the influence of topical sucralfate on pain score postoperatively (24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days), pethidine usage, diclofenac usage, and wound healing rate compared to placebo. This study was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. This study sorted the final six studies with 439 patients underwent haemorrhoidectomy.

,,Systematic review of economic evaluations of human cell-derived wound care products for the treatment of venous leg and diabetic foot ulcers,BMC Health Services Research,2009.0,"BackgroundTissue engineering is an emerging field. Novel bioengineered skin substitutes and genetically derived growth factors offer innovative approaches to reduce the burden of diabetic foot and venous leg ulcers for both patients and health care systems. However, they frequently are very costly. Based on a systematic review of the literature, this study assesses the cost-effectiveness of these growth factors and tissue-engineered artificial skin for treating chronic wounds.MethodsOn the basis of an extensive explorative search, an appropriate algorithm for a systematic database search was developed. The following databases were searched: BIOSIS Previews, CRD databases, Cochrane Library, EconLit, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science. Only completed and published trial- or model-based studies which contained a full economic evaluation of growth factors and bioengineered skin substitutes for the treatment of chronic wounds were included. Two reviewers independently undertook the assessment of study quality. The relevant studies were assessed by a modified version of the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) list and a published checklist for evaluating model-based economic evaluations.ResultsEleven health economic evaluations were included. Three biotechnology products were identified for which topical growth factors or bioengineered skin substitutes for the treatment of chronic leg ulceration were economically assessed: (1) Apligraf®, a bilayered living human skin equivalent indicated for the treatment of diabetic foot and venous leg ulcers (five studies); (2) Dermagraft®, a human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute, which is indicated only for use in the treatment of full-thickness diabetic foot ulcers (one study); (3) REGRANEX® Gel, a human platelet-derived growth factor for the treatment of deep neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (five studies). The studies considered in this review were of varying and partly low methodological quality. They calculated that due to shorter treatment periods, fewer complications and fewer inpatient episodes the initial cost of the novel biotechnology products may be offset, making the treatment cost-effective or even cost-saving. The results of most studies were sensitive to initial costs of the products and the evidence of effectiveness.ConclusionThe study results suggest that some growth factors and tissue-engineered artificial skin products feature favourable cost-effectiveness ratios in selected patient groups with chronic wounds. Despite the limitations of the studies considered, it is evident that health care providers and coverage decision makers should take not only the high cost of the biotechnology product but the total cost of care into account when deciding about the appropriate allocation of their financial resources. However, not only the cost-effectiveness but first of all the effectiveness of these novel biotechnology products deserve further research.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,1,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,antimicrobial,none,6.0
,,The outcomes and experience of people receiving community-based nurse-led wound care: A systematic review.,Journal of clinical nursing,2020.0,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To review the literature related to the outcomes and experience of people receiving nurse-led care for chronic wounds in the community.


BACKGROUND
Chronic wounds lead to a poor quality of life and are an economic burden to the Australian healthcare system. A lack of awareness into the significance of chronic wounds leads to limited resources being available to facilitate the provision of evidence-based care. The majority of chronic wounds are managed by nurses in the community and a better understanding into current models of care are required to inform future practice.


DESIGN
A systematic quantitative literature review.


METHODS
A systematic search was conducted in four electronic databases and the inclusion criteria were: English language, peer-reviewed, published from 2009 to 2019 and primary research. The data was compiled into an Excel database for reporting as per the Pickering and Byrne (2014) method of systematic quantitative literature review. This review used the PRISMA checklist. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used for quality appraisal.


RESULTS
Twelve studies were included in the review. Home nursing care, social community care and nursing within a wound clinic were identified as three types of nurse-led care in the literature. The findings demonstrate that nurse-led care was cost-effective, reported high levels of client satisfaction and contributed to improved wound healing and reduced levels of pain.


CONCLUSIONS
Nurse-led care is a positive experience for people with chronic wounds and leads to better outcomes. The findings suggested a need for further client education and specialised training for healthcare practitioners managing chronic wounds.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
This review demonstrates that nurse-led care for people with chronic wounds in the community is cost-effective and improves client outcomes.

,,The Effects of Cellular Skin Substitutes on Diabetic Foot Ulcer Healing: A Systematic Review,Principles and Practice of Clinical Research Journal,2024.0,"Introduction: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most common lower extremity diabetes-related complications. New therapies have been developed to increase the likelihood of wound healing and reduce complications, including biological and/or synthetic grafts that allow a temporary or permanent occlusion of wounds. Although their efficacy has been demonstrated, novel skin substitutes have been available, and few studies have described the head-to-head comparative effectiveness of those products. Therefore, this mini-review aims to analyze the available randomized clinical trials studying the impact of different cellular skin products on the healing of DFUs. Methods: The databases PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Scielo, and Lilacs were assessed from inception to July 30th, 2023, to identify randomized clinical trials on the effects of cellular skin substitutes on ulcer healing in adult patients aged 18 years or older with DFUs restricted to the skin and subcutaneous tissue, compared to standard of care or other skin substitutes. Results: Based on eligibility criteria, 22 articles were selected. These studies showed the efficacy and safety of cell skin substitutes compared to standard treatments, as demonstrated by the reduction in the total area of the ulcer and rates of complete wound healing. We identified a few studies with head-to-head comparisons among those products. Discussion: Cellular skin substitutes have shown promising results in healing DFUs as complementary therapies to the standard of care. Their incorporation into standard-of-care treatments could be discussed. Future studies should focus on head-to-head comparisons, cost-effective analysis, and long-term efficacy and safety.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0
,,Efficacy of MMP-inhibiting wound dressings in the treatment of hard-to-heal wounds: a systematic review.,Journal of wound care,2020.0,"OBJECTIVE
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) substantially contribute to the development of chronicity in wounds. Thus, MMP-inhibiting dressings may support healing. A systematic review was performed to determine the existing evidence base for the treatment of hard-to-heal wounds with these dressings.


METHODS
A systematic literature search in databases and clinical trial registers was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of MMP-inhibiting dressings. Studies were analysed regarding their quality and clinical evidence.


RESULTS
Of 721 hits, 16 relevant studies were assessed. There were 13 studies performed with collagen and three with technology lipido-colloid nano oligosaccharide factor (TLC-NOSF) dressings. Indications included diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers or wounds of mixed origin. Patient-relevant endpoints comprised wound size reduction, complete wound closure, healing time and rate. Considerable differences in the quality and subsequent clinical evidence exist between the studies identified. Substantial evidence for significant improvement in healing was identified only for some dressings.


CONCLUSION
Evidence for the superiority of some MMP-inhibiting wound dressings exists regarding wound closure, wound size reduction, healing time and healing rate. More research is required to substantiate the existing evidence for different types of hard-to-heal wounds and to generate evidence for some of the different types of MMP-inhibiting wound dressings.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,12.0

This study aims to identify, define, and analyse the knowledge tests developed for the measurement of nurses' wound care knowledge, and to evaluate the psychometric properties of the tests. This study was a systematic literature review. A total of 52 studies and 18 instruments were found. Of the 18 instruments, only 5 had been used more than once and were successful in a psychometric evaluation. These five instruments were analysed on the basis of their psychometric properties by using Zwakhalen et al.'s (2006) psychometric testing framework. According to the analysis, the Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Test (PUKT) and the Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Assessment Tool (PUKAT) were the most valid and reliable instruments for measuring nurses' wound care knowledge.

,,The Potential of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma Gel for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Care Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management,2024.0,"Introduction Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus can lead to the development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), which is a frequent complication in patients. However, several diabetes management guidelines for older adults do not mention the occurrence of DFUs. Nowadays, Autologous Platelet-Rich Gel (APG) is being used for treating diabetic ulcers. APG is an innovative platelet-derived product with many advantages, such as being low-cost, easy to produce, and readily available materials. Additionally, it does not lead to any rejection reaction. Objective This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of APG as a novel treatment of DFU compared with standard treatment in older adult patients. Methods Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were searched using PubMed, Cochrane, Google Scholar, Wiley, and PlosOne. The keywords have been arranged using the Boolean operator, including autologous platelet-rich gel, DFU, and elderly. The data was screened by inclusion and exclusion criteria. The final inclusion study was analyzed and synthesized by tabulation, clusterization, contextual and thematic approach, and assessed for risk of bias using ROB 2.0. Meta-analysis was conducted by using Review Manager 5.4 and the Mantel Haenszel method. Results Eight RCTs with 598 patients were eligible for the present analysis. Compared with standard care/conventional treatment, APG could significantly improve the healing wound in patients with diabetic foot ulcers (Relative risk (RR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22–1.57, p < 0.0001), shortened the healing time (Mean difference [MD] −16.97 days (95% CI: −32.64 to −1.29; p < 0.00001), shortened the length of hospital stay (MD= −20.11, 95% CI: −38.02, −2.20; p = 0.03), and amputation rate (MD= 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.84; p = 0.02).

DATA SOURCES Data sources included PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), WEIPU, and WANFANG databases. STUDY SELECTION Investigators included 14 studies discussing the effects of PLA-based biomaterials in cutaneous wound healing published from 2000 to 2021. DATA EXTRACTION Authors extracted the following information from the selected studies: general information, study type, type of wound, PLA-based biomaterials and techniques, study period, outcome measures, and results. DATA SYNTHESIS Polylactic acid-based biomaterials may promote wound healing through wound area repair, collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and cell activities, which are related to the good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and moisture management properties of PLA. A proper product structure may also help. Both the native PLA materials and PLA blends seem to be antibacterial, although more evidence is needed for the native PLA products. Because there was no severe adverse event or obvious cytotoxicity observed in the included studies, PLA-based biomaterials are likely safe.

,,Corticosteroid use in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes,Critical Care,2020.0,"Background In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been worldwide debate on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. In the recent RECOVERY trial, evaluating the effect of dexamethasone, a reduced 28-day mortality in patients requiring oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation was shown. Their results have led to considering amendments in guidelines or actually already recommending corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids still remain uncertain, and reliable data to further shed light on the benefit and harm are needed. Objectives The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature search of RCTS and observational studies on adult patients was performed across Medline/PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from December 1, 2019, until October 1, 2020, according to the PRISMA guidelines. Primary outcomes were short-term mortality and viral clearance (based on RT-PCR in respiratory specimens). Secondary outcomes were: need for mechanical ventilation, need for other oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay and secondary infections. Results Forty-four studies were included, covering 20.197 patients. In twenty-two studies, the effect of corticosteroid use on mortality was quantified. The overall pooled estimate (observational studies and RCTs) showed a significant reduced mortality in the corticosteroid group (OR 0.72 (95%CI 0.57–0.87). Furthermore, viral clearance time ranged from 10 to 29 days in the corticosteroid group and from 8 to 24 days in the standard of care group. Fourteen studies reported a positive effect of corticosteroids on need for and duration of mechanical ventilation. A trend toward more infections and antibiotic use was present. Conclusions Our findings from both observational studies and RCTs confirm a beneficial effect of corticosteroids on short-term mortality and a reduction in need for mechanical ventilation. And although data in the studies were too sparse to draw any firm conclusions, there might be a signal of delayed viral clearance and an increase in secondary infections.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,True,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the complete wound epithelialization and postoperative pain when PRF was used in palatal wounds following free gingival graft (FGG) harvesting. Material and Methods PubMed (Medline), EMBASE and Scopus were searched by two independent individuals up to and including March 2020 in order to identify controlled and randomized controlled clinical trials on the use of PRF at palatal donor sites of FGG. The outcomes assessed were epithelialization and postoperative pain. The risk of bias of the included studies was evaluated using Cochrane Collaboration’s domain-based two-part tool. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted with 95% confidence intervals. Results The search strategy identified 555 potentially eligible articles, of which 6 randomized controlled clinical trials were included. In the qualitative analysis, most studies (83.3%) reported lower postoperative pain in treatment groups, while all studies accessing epithelialization demonstrated earlier complete wound closure in groups treated with PRF. The discomfort and complete re-epithelialization were more favorable in groups PRF when compared to control groups (P<0.00001).

,,Evidence for person-centred care in chronic wound care: A systematic review and recommendations for practice.,Journal of wound care,2020.0,"BACKGROUND
Chronic wounds affect an estimated 2.21 per 1000 population. They are a significant source of morbidity and affect individuals physically, psychologically, socially and financially. Person-centered care is one approach to improve patient outcomes in wound care as it values patients' perspectives, beliefs and autonomy and considers the person as a whole within the cultural context in which care is provided.


AIM
We aimed to review the evidence on the use of person-centered care (PCC) in chronic wound care management and provide recommendations for practice and future research.


METHOD
Using a systematic review methodology, we searched six databases for full-text papers from 2009-2019 published in peer-reviewed journals with no limits on language.


RESULTS
Eighteen articles on studies involving 3149 patients from nine countries were identified. Studies were conducted under three broad intervention categories: healthcare professional education (n=1); patient education (n=14) and telemedicine (n=3). Studies were equally focused on prevention and treatment of chronic wounds. Significant improvements were reported in patient knowledge, pain and self-care behaviours. Only two studies evaluated the impact on wound healing and one study estimated the cost of implementing person-centered care.


CONCLUSIONS
The evidence base to support PCC in wound management is developing and based on our review has shown improved outcomes in areas of pressure ulcer prevention, patient satisfaction, patient knowledge and quality of life, but clinical outcomes such as wound healing were less well explored. Further research with more objective outcome measures are required.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,9.0
,,Image Based Artificial Intelligence in Wound Assessment: A Systematic Review,Advances in wound care,2020.0,"SIGNIFICANCE
Accurately predicting wound healing trajectories is difficult for wound care clinicians due to the complex and dynamic processes involved in wound healing. Wound care teams capture images of wounds during clinical visits generating big data sets over time. Developing novel artificial intelligence (AI) systems can help clinicians diagnose, assess the effectiveness of therapy, and predict healing outcomes. Recent Advances: Rapid developments in computer processing have enabled the development of AI-based systems that can improve the diagnosis and effectiveness of therapy in various clinical specializations. In the past decade, we have witnessed AI revolutionizing all types of medical imaging like X-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, etc., but AI-based systems remain to be developed clinically and computationally for high-quality wound care that can result in better patient outcomes.


CRITICAL ISSUES
In the current standard of care, collecting wound images on every clinical visit, interpreting and archiving the data are cumbersome and time-consuming. Commercial platforms are developed to capture images, perform wound measurements, and provide clinicians with a workflow for diagnosis, but AI-based systems are still in their infancy. This systematic review summarizes the breadth and depth of the most recent and relevant work in intelligent image-based data analysis and system developments for wound assessment.


FUTURE DIRECTIONS
With increasing availabilities of massive data (wound images, wound-specific electronic health records, etc.) as well as powerful computing resources, AI-based digital platforms will play a significant role in delivering data-driven care to people suffering from debilitating chronic wounds.",Semantic Scholar,2,0,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,wound_assessment,none,11.0

A systematic review was conducted (Embase/PubMed, November 2020) to identify relevant comparative studies meeting inclusion criteria. Meta‐analyses were performed using a fixed‐effects (I2 < 50%) or random‐effects model (I2 ≥ 50%) depending on statistical heterogeneity. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals. In total, 436 publications were identified of which 13 were comparative trials including outcomes of interest. Significant reductions in exudate, pus/debris, slough, bioburden, and infection were reported in chronic wounds treated with CIOD, compared with standard of care (SOC). Meta‐analyses highlighted the positive impact of CIOD on mean wound area reduction (MD = 2.35 cm2, 95% CI = 0.34–4.36, P = .0219) after eight weeks treatment and overall wound healing events compared to SOC; wounds including venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers treated with CIOD were more than twice as likely to heal than those receiving SOC (RR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.54–3.45, P < .0001).

Prompt, evidence-based management focusing on optimal wound closure, early wound care, and scar prevention is essential to achieving favorable long-term outcomes. This review summarizes findings from a comprehensive literature review conducted from 2010 to 2025, drawing from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical guidelines addressing pediatric facial laceration repair, wound care practices, scar prevention, and caregiver involvement. Practical interventions accessible over the counter (OTC) were emphasized. Evidence supports the use of topical anesthetics such as lidocaine-epinephrine-tetracaine (LET) gel to reduce procedural pain, copious irrigation with potable water, and wound closure methods tailored to the injury’s characteristics, including tissue adhesives and absorbable sutures. Routine systemic antibiotics are not indicated for clean facial wounds. Early moist wound care with petrolatum promotes faster healing, while scar prevention measures such as silicone therapy, sun protection, scar massage, and tension offloading techniques significantly improve cosmetic outcomes. Over-the-counter products such as onion extract and vitamin E offer minimal benefit compared to silicone-based therapies.

Only two RCTS (40%) reported significant beneficial effects of chitosan on wound healing compared with conventional gauze dressings. The remaining three studies reported that chitosan had no significant effect on clinical wound healing compared with other biological dressings.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the number of trials of new chitosan dressings has been increasing, studies on the relationship between chitosan and wound healing have been limited. Current data suggest that chitosan does not slow wound healing. However, the small number of available trials restricted the adequate interpretation of the existing results. Future research needs to be rigorously designed to confirm the effect of chitosan in clinical wound healing.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0
,,Ultrasound-Assisted Wound (UAW) Debridement in the Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Journal of Clinical Medicine,2022.0,"A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to investigate the effect of ultrasound-assisted wound (UAW) debridement in patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). All selected studies were evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias for randomized controlled trials. PubMed and Web of Science were searched in October 2021 to find randomized clinical trials (RCT) assessing the effect of UAW debridement on DFUs. RevMan v5.4. was used to analyze the data with the Mantel–Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes. A total of 8 RCT met our inclusion criteria, with 263 participants. Concerning the healing rate comparing UAW versus the control group, a meta-analysis estimated the pooled OR at 2.22 (95% CI 0.96–5.11, p = 0.06), favoring UAW debridement, with low heterogeneity (x2 = 7.47, df = 5, p = 0.19, I2 = 33%). Time to healing was similar in both groups: UAW group (14.25 ± 10.10 weeks) versus the control group (13.38 ± 1.99 weeks, p = 0.87). Wound area reduction was greater in the UAW debridement group (74.58% ± 19.21%) than in the control group (56.86% ± 25.09%), although no significant differences were observed between them (p = 0.24). UAW debridement showed higher healing rates, a greater percentage of wound area reduction, and similar healing times when compared with placebo (sham device) and standard of care in patients with DFUs, although no statistically significant differences were observed between groups.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0
,,Evidence supporting wound care end points relevant to clinical practice and patients’ lives. Part 2. Literature survey,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2018.0,"Patients with wounds bear significant clinical, personal, and economic burdens yet complete wound healing is the only United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized primary clinical trial end point. The overall goal of this project is to work with FDA to expand the list of acceptable primary end points, recognizing that new and innovative treatments, devices, and drugs may not have complete healing as the focus. Part 1 of the project surveyed 628 wound care experts who identified and content‐validated 15 end points most relevant to clinical practice and benefitting patients’ lives as primary outcomes in clinical trials. Part 2 is focused on critical appraisal of the evidence in the wound care literature supporting FDA criteria to qualify these 15 end points as primary end points in clinical trials. Further research involved systematic review of the literature regarding the most promising end points. Forty volunteer, interdisciplinary, wound healing experts in fields related to the end points compiled evidence from systematic MEDLINE searches and society databases supporting the FDA criteria of reliability, clinical construct validity, capacity to detect concurrent or longitudinal change, and responder analysis. The search revealed 485 references involving over 462,000 subjects supporting FDA‐required parameters for all 15 end points More than 50 references supported FDA‐required parameters qualifying the following outcomes for use in clinical trials supporting interventions for FDA clearance: Pain reduction, Physical function and ambulation, Infection reduction, Time to heal, and Percent wound area reduction in 4–8 weeks. Among these, only Time to heal is currently recognized by the FDA as a primary wound outcome in clinical trials.

,,A systematic review of Calendula officinalis extract for wound healing,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2019.0,"Use of complementary and alternative medicine for wound healing is influencing mainstream medical practice. This systematic review evaluates the role of Calendula officinalis flower extract as monotherapy compared to control for wound healing in vivo. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Scopus (up to April 2018) with 14 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, comprising 7 animal experiments and 7 clinical trials. Findings from the review on acute wound healing showed faster resolution of the inflammation phase with increased production of granulation tissue in the test groups treated with extract. These findings were consistent in five animal studies and one randomized clinical trial. Chronic wound healing studies were varied. Two clinical control studies on venous ulcers demonstrated decreased ulcer surface area compared to controls. Another randomized clinical trial demonstrated no improvement for the calendula group in diabetic leg ulcer healing. Burn healing similarly showed mixed results. Two animal studies demonstrated a prophylactic effect for the administration of calendula extract prior to burn injury. A randomized clinical trial of patients suffering from partial to full thickness burns demonstrated no benefit for topical application of calendula extract compared to controls. Two randomized clinical trials assessed the potential for extract to prevent acute post radiation dermatitis, with one study showing improvements compared to trolamine, while the other found no improvement compared to aqua gel cream. Animal studies provide moderate evidence for improved recovery from the inflammation phase and increased production of granulation tissue in calendula extract treatment groups. This review identified some evidence for the beneficial effects of C. officinalis extract for wound healing, consistent with its role in traditional medicine.

A search was conducted in six life science databases to identify clinical trials carried out on permanent teeth with a carious pulp exposure and a recall interval of at least six months. Twenty-seven trials of low to moderate risk of bias (RoB-2 and ROBINS-I) were included. Data was extracted and analyzed regarding study characteristics and methods used for pulp wound lavage. The agent used for pulp wound lavage was specified in all included trials. Most of the identified trials (23/27) randomized the pulp capping material. Many (14/27) reported the use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl); ten used only saline or water. One trial was identified that compared pulp wound lavage with 2.5% (NaOCl) to saline, another compared 5% glutaraldehyde to water, both in immature molar pulpotomies. Both studies were underpowered. Neither showed a significant difference between treatments. The use of NaOCl was positively correlated to recent year of publication and use of hydraulic calcium silicate cements for pulp capping (p < 0.05). In conclusion, despite a lack of well-designed trials on pulp wound lavage in VPT, a trend towards using NaOCl for this purpose was observed.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0
,,Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Pediatric Burn Patients: A Systematic Review.,Advances in wound care,2020.0,"Significance Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) requires the placement of a dressing over a wound, covered with an adhesive film, and applying to these dressing a negative pressure in a controlled fashion. This therapy is a powerful complement to surgical care of wounds. Data is however poor on its use in pediatrics burns. Recent Advances This systematic review, including a total of 466 patients, shows that NPWT as the initial treatment for burned children and after skin grafting has been shown to produce promising results. In the majority of studies skin graft take rate is close to 100%. This therapy is particularly beneficial in the pediatric population because of less frequent dressing changes and early mobilization. NPWT devices accurately quantify burns water losses and allow tailoring liquid resuscitation. Critical Issues NPWT is not in the subject of controlled clinical trials in pediatric; most publications are case reports or retrospective reviews. The sporadic complications include bleeding, local infections and mechanical device issues. Future Directions NPWT has been used in 2-months up to 18-years old children with deep 2nd to 3th degree burn of multiple etiologies, from a few days up to several months, on small to 40% TBSA surfaces, and in difficult areas. Data gathered provides empirical guidelines on NPWT use in pediatrics burns using continuous mode with a pressure of -50 to -75 mmHg for children younger than 2 years, and -75 to -125 mmHg in children over 2-years of age.

,,Initial reduction in ulcer size as a prognostic indicator for complete wound healing: a systematic review of diabetic foot and venous leg ulcers.,Advances in wound care,2022.0,"Significance Percent area reduction (PAR) is commonly reported in trials including diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and venous leg ulcers (VLU). It's unclear how well PAR performs as a surrogate marker for complete wound closure. This review aimed to summarise all available evidence evaluating PAR as a predictor of complete DFU and VLU healing. Recent Advances A review searching the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMCARE databases was conducted in accordance with PRISMA. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies reporting PAR and any measure of its predictive ability were included. Outcomes included performance measures of PAR, timing of PAR and outcome measurement, and specific PAR cut-offs. Critical Issues Meta-analysis was not possible due to high variability in wound duration at study start (2-48 weeks), PAR timing (2-8 weeks), PAR cut-off (-3 to 90%; determined post-hoc in most studies), and outcome assessment (10-24 weeks). Six studies (21,430 DFU patients) report PAR as having acceptable to outstanding discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.720-0.910). Five studies (29,775 VLU patients) report PAR as having poor to excellent discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.680-0.830). One study (241 DFU and VLU patients) reports PAR sensitivity and specificity of 58.5% and 90.5% respectively. All studies were determined to have high risk of bias. Future Directions Despite promising discriminatory ability, most studies report post-hoc analysis of patients in randomised trials, are highly heterogenous in study design, and have high risk of bias.

This manuscript presents the combined clinical trial experience with NXB in children. Hundred and ten children aged 0.5 to 18 years suffering from deep thermal burns of up to 67% total body surface area were treated with NXB in three clinical trials. Seventy‐seven children were treated with NXB in a phase I/II study, where 92.7% of the areas treated achieved complete eschar removal within 0.9 days from admission. Thirty‐three children (17 NXB, 16 standard of care [SOC]) participated in a phase III randomized controlled trial. All wounds treated with NXB achieved complete eschar removal. Time to complete eschar removal (from informed consent) was 0.9 days for NXB vs 6.5 days for SOC (P < .001). The incidence of surgical excision was 7.9% for NXB vs 73.3% for SOC (P < .001). Seventeen of these children participated in a phase III‐b follow‐up study (9 NXB and 8 SOC).

,,Chronic wounds in Australia: A systematic review of key epidemiological and clinical parameters,International Wound Journal,2018.0,"Chronic wounds are a significant problem in Australia. The health care‐related costs of chronic wounds in Australia are considerable, equivalent to more than AUD $3.5 billion, approximately 2% of national health care expenditure. Chronic wounds can also have a significant negative impact on the health‐related quality of life of affected individuals. Studies have demonstrated that evidence‐based care for chronic wounds improves clinical outcomes. Decision analytical modelling is important in confirming and applying these findings in the Australian context. Epidemiological and clinical data on chronic wounds are required to populate decision analytical models. Although epidemiological and clinical data on chronic wounds in Australia are available, these data have yet to be systematically summarised. To address these omissions and clarify the state of existing evidence, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on key epidemiological and clinical parameters of chronic wounds in Australia.

,,Medicinal Plants as Efficacious Agents for Diabetic Foot Ulcers: A Systematic Review of Clinical Studies.,Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,2021.0,"A diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a chronic, nonhealing wound that occurs in approximately 15% to 25% of patients with diabetes, and amputation is necessary in approximately 5% to 24% of these patients. Medicinal plants have demonstrated promising wound healing activities in animal models of DFUs as well as in clinical studies. These plants, which are described as medicinal in different regions of the world, are not considered to be standard medicinal treatments in Western medicine at this time. Some medicinal products, such as bromelain-an herbal protease currently used for enzymatic debridement of wounds-have been obtained from plants, showing the important role of these natural products as sources of wound healing agents. This paper aims to review clinical studies on the effects of medicinal plants in patients with DFUs based on the improvement of local and systemic parameters related to wound healing. Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies from inception through May 2019 using the keywords ""diabetic foot ulcer"" and ""plant,"" ""phytochemical,"" ""extract,"" or ""herb."" Inclusion criteria were controlled or before-after clinical studies with English-language full-text in which topical or systemic herbal preparations for DFUs were evaluated by considering outcomes such as reduction of wound healing time and wound area, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and number of cases requiring amputation. Studies on non-herbal materials and human studies other than clinical trials were excluded. Fourteen studies were included in the present review. Herbal medicines were administered as add-on therapy to standard wound care in the form of topical (cream, gel, oil) or systemic (capsule, decoction, injection) preparations. Parameters such as ulcer width and depth, phagocytic function, tumor necrosis factor α level, epithelialization, vascularization, and wound closure were evaluated in clinical trials, several of which were significantly improved in patients compared with their baseline values or control group.

,,The Promising Hydrogel Candidates for Preclinically Treating Diabetic Foot Ulcer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Advances in wound care,2022.0,"SIGNIFICANCE
Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) causes high amputation rates owing to its aberrant wound healing. Traditional dressings cannot effectively contribute to DFU healing. Functional hydrogels have been proposed as a promising novel dressing to treat DFU in future, but the evidence for various hydrogels to heal DFU is still ambiguous. Recent Advances: In accord with PRISMA and CONSORT guidelines, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of functional hydrogels. Four electronic databases and one website were used for data searching. Twenty-four in animal studies and six clinical trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 399 diabetic murine models and 278 patients with DFU.


CRITICAL ISSUES
Functional hydrogels accelerated the healing progress for DFU disease and relieved symptoms in patients. According to their characteristics, the functional hydrogels were divided into antioxidant hydrogel (AOH), antibacterial hydrogel (ABH), multifunctional hydrogel (MFH), proangiogenic hydrogel (PAH), and hydrogel promoting proliferation (PPH). By network meta-analysis, AOH and MFH were considered the premium options for treating wounds of diabetic patients at whole stage. Future Direction: Functional hydrogels effectively accelerate healing rates in wounds of diabetic animals. Hydrogels of AOH and MFH might become the ideal candidates for clinical trials on DFU treatment, based on the Meta-analyses from the reported work. Early treatment with AOH followed a week later with ABH might become an advanced strategy for DFU disease in future. This information is very important for researchers or/and physicians in taking consideration for alternate application of hydrogel dressings.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,1,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,antimicrobial,none,11.0

A systematic literature search was performed and randomised controlled trials with a focus on educational interventions were included. Wound healing was analysed by assessing wound healing rate, ulcer size, and the PUSH Score. Additional outcomes comprised pain, quality of life, and functional ability. The study protocol for this work is registered at PROSPERO 2020 (ID: CRD42021286152). Nine studies were included in this meta‐analysis. The odds ratio for wound healing was 1.91 (95% CI, 0.99–3.67, P = .053) in favour of educational interventions compared to usual care. Ulcer size reduction was higher (MD: ‐7.22; 95% CI, −11.91 to −2.53, P = .003) in patients following educational interventions. Included studies also showed significant effects on pain, quality of life, and functional analysis, though no quantitative synthesis was feasible. The overall risk of bias showed some concerns. Educational interventions aim to actively involve patients in their treatment, thereby appearing to be able to have a positive impact on wound healing within 12 weeks.

The aim of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of topical ozone in the treatment of mammalian wounds. A structured search of five scientific databases returned a total of 390 unique studies. Of these, 22 studies were included in this review. Four studies provided enough data to be included in a meta‐analysis evaluating the time to complete wound healing. All studies were randomised controlled trials of humans or other mammalian animals that reported clinical signs of wound healing. Each study was critically analysed by a six‐point assessment of the risk of bias. Wounds treated with topical ozone had a greater reduction in wound size than similar wounds treated with controls or standard of care in all studies. Those treated with ozonated liquids also had a shorter time to wound healing by approximately one week. In conclusion, topical ozone contributed to enhanced wound healing in all studies.

DATA SOURCES An electronic search of PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Clinical Trials databases for articles published from 1999 to 2019 was conducted using the following MeSH search terms: telewound, wound, wound care, remote care, telehealth, telemedicine, eHealth, mobile health, pressure injury, and ulcer. STUDY SELECTION Articles were included if they were a scientific report of a single study; evaluated a telehealth method; identified the type of wound of focus; and provided data on clinical, healthcare utilization, or cost outcomes of telewound care. In total, 26 articles met these criteria. DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted and grouped into 13 categories, including study design, wound type, telehealth modality, treatment intervention, and outcomes measured, among others. DATA SYNTHESIS Of the 26 studies, 19 reported on clinical outcomes including overall healing and healing time; 17 studies reported on healthcare utilization including hospitalizations and length of stay; and 12 studies reported costs. CONCLUSIONS Evidence regarding the use of telewound care is weak, and findings related to the impact of telewound care on outcomes are inconsistent but indicate that it is not inferior to in-person care. Greater use of telehealth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic points to further development of navigation and education models of telehealth for wound care.

,,Evidence-Based Review of Anti-Biofilm Agents for Wound Care.,Advances in wound care,2020.0,"Significance Biofilms in vivo are small densely packed aggregations of microbes that are highly resistant to host immune responses and treatment. Biofilms attach to each other and to nearby surfaces. They are difficult to study and identify in a clinical setting as their quantification necessitates the use of advanced microscopy techniques such as confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM). Nonetheless it is likely that biofilms contribute to the pathophysiology of chronic skin wounds. Reducing, removing or preventing biofilms is thus a logical approach to help clinicians heal chronic wounds. Recent Advances Wound care products have demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy in destroying biofilms in in vitro and pre-clinical models as well as in some clinical studies. Critical Issues Controlled studies exploring the beneficial role of biofilm eradication and its relationship to healing in patients with chronic wounds are limited. This review aims to discuss the mode of action and clinical significance of currently available anti-biofilm products including surfactants, dressings and others, with a focus on levels of evidence for efficacy in disrupting biofilms and ability to improve wound healing outcomes. Future Directions Few available products have good evidence to support anti-biofilm activity and wound healing benefits. Novel therapeutic strategies are on the horizon.

,,Effects of non‐pharmacological interventions on pain intensity of children with burns: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,International Wound Journal,2023.0,"Pain is one of the complications associated with burns, which can lead to anxiety and sleeplessness in children. Various studies evaluated the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions on burn wound care. The present study was conducted to determine the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions on pain intensity of children with burns. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in various international electronic databases, such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Persian electronic databases such as Iranmedex, and Scientific Information Database using keywords extracted from Medical Subject Headings such as ‘Non‐pharmacological’, ‘Virtual reality’, ‘Pain’, ‘Burn’, ‘Wound’ and ‘Child’ from the earliest to December 1, 2022. The risk of bias in the final articles was also assessed with the Version 2 of the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Finally, a total of 1005 burn patients were included in 19 studies. The age range of the patients was from 0.5 to 19 years. Of the participants, 50.05% were in the intervention group. All studies had a randomised clinical trial design. The results found that non‐pharmacological interventions significantly reduced pain intensity in children (ES: −0.73, 95% CI: −1.08 to −0.38, Z = 4.09, I2:79.8, P < .001). Virtual reality (VR) (ES: −0.54, 95% CI: −1.19 to −0.18, Z = 2.90, I2:72.9%, P = .004) and non‐VR (ES: ‐0.86, 95% CI: −1.45 to −0.27, Z = 2.86, I2:91.4%, P = .04) interventions decreased pain intensity significantly in children based sub‐group analysis. Non‐pharmacological interventions significantly reduced the pain intensity of dressing removal (ES: −0.77, 95% CI: −1.34 to −0.20, Z = 66.3, I2:91.8%, P = .008), dressing application (ES: −0.53, 95% CI: −0.97 to −0.09, Z = 2.37, I2:60.8%, P = .02), and physical therapy (ES: −1.18, 95% CI: −2.10 to −0.26, Z = 2.51, I2:88.0%, P = .01). Also, interventions reduced the pain of burn wound care (ES: −0.29, 95% CI: −1.01 to 0.44, Z = 0.78, I2:72.6%, P = .43), but it was statistically insignificant. In sum, the result of the present study indicated that using non‐pharmacological interventions significantly reduced pain intensity in children.

However, the efficacy and safety profiles of AVP and TP have not been determined in pediatric refractory shock of different origins. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the addition of AVP/TP therapy in pediatric refractory shock of all causes compared to conventional therapy with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor and inotropic therapy.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis (TSA) comparing AVP and TP to conventional therapy. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to February 2016. The systematic review included all reports of AVP/TP use in the pediatric population. Reports of clinical trials were pooled using random-effects models and TSA. Main outcomes were mortality and tissue ischemia.ResultsThree randomized controlled trials and five “before-and-after clinical” trials (without comparator) met the inclusion criteria. Among 224 neonates and children (aged 0 to 18 years) with refractory shock, 152 received therapy with AVP or TP. Pooled analyses showed no association between AVP/TP treatment and mortality (relative risk (RR),1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71–2.00), length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) (mean difference (MD), –3.58 days; 95% CI, –9.05 to 1.83), and tissue ischemia (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.47–4.62). In TSA, no significant effect on mortality and risk for developing tissue ischemia was observed with AVP/TP therapy.ConclusionOur results emphasize the lack of observed benefit for AVP/TP in terms of mortality and length of stay in the PICU, and suggest an increased risk for ischemic events.

We analysed all studies combined and divided them into the subgroups: sepsis, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (CPB), other severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery from cardiac arrest. The meta-analysis was registered in advance (PROSPERO: CRD42022290334). Results Of an initial 1295 publications, 34 studies were found eligible, including 1297 patients treated with CytoSorb® and 1314 controls. Cytosorb® intervention did not lower mortality (RR [95%-CI]: all studies 1.07 [0.88; 1.31], sepsis 0.98 [0.74; 1.31], CPB surgery 0.91 [0.64; 1.29], severe illness 0.95 [0.59; 1.55], SARS-CoV-2 1.58 [0.50; 4.94]). In patients with cardiac arrest, we found a significant survival advantage of the untreated controls (1.22 [1.02; 1.46]). We did not find significant differences in ICU length of stay, lactate levels, or IL-6 levels after treatment. Of the eligible 34 studies only 12 were randomized controlled trials. All observational studies showed moderate to serious risk of bias. Interpretation To date, there is no evidence for a positive effect of the CytoSorb® adsorber on mortality across a variety of diagnoses that justifies its widespread use in intensive care medicine.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,1,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,True,,,,,A,High,,infection,none,11.5
,,Systematic review of the use of cyanoacrylate glue in addition to standard wound closure in the prevention of surgical site infection,International Wound Journal,2018.0,"Surgical site infection (SSI) is associated with increased morbidity, length of stay, and cost. Cyanoacrylate glue is a low‐cost, fluid‐proof, antimicrobial barrier. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the use of cyanoacrylate glue after standard wound closure versus dressings in the reduction of SSI. Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and clinical trial registries were searched with no restrictions in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria were prospective studies comparing glue versus dressings after standardised wound closure. Two reviewers independently screened articles and utilised GRADE for quality assessment. Meta‐analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of the data. Three articles were included in the review. Study quality was uniformly low. Incidence of SSI was low, between 0% and 4%. No significant differences were reported in the single randomised controlled trial. A single non‐randomised parallel group trial reported a significant reduction in the incidence of SSI in the cyanoacrylate group. There was no consistent evidence demonstrating reduction in SSI as a result of the use of cyanoacrylate glue. Future studies should assess the use of cyanoacrylate in procedures with a higher rate of SSI, for example, lower limb bypass.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,10,1,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,antimicrobial,27.0

,,The Effect of Aloe Vera Clinical Trials on Prevention and Healing of Skin Wound: A Systematic Review,Iranian Journal of Medical Sciences,2019.0,"Background: Aloe vera is an herbaceous and perennial plant that belongs to the Liliaceae family and used for many medicinal purposes. The present study aimed to systematically review clinical trials regarding the effect of Aloe vera on the prevention and healing of skin wounds. Methods: To identify all related published studies, we searched SID, IRANDOC, Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect databases in both the English and Persian languages from 1990 to 2016. The keywords used were Aloe vera, wound healing, and prevention. All clinical trials using Aloe vera gel, cream, or derivatives that included a control group with placebo or comparison with other treatments were included in the study. The PRISMA checklist (2009) was used to conduct the review. Results: In total, 23 trials that met the inclusion criteria were studied. The results of the studies showed that Aloe vera has been used to prevent skin ulcers and to treat burn wounds, postoperative wounds, cracked nipples, genital herpes, psoriasis, and chronic wounds including pressure ulcers. Conclusion: Considering the properties of Aloe vera and its compounds, it can be used to retain skin moisture and integrity and to prevent ulcers.

,,Effect of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized cohort studies,Critical Care,2021.0,"Although several international guidelines recommend early over late intubation of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this issue is still controversial. We aimed to investigate the effect (if any) of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched, while references and preprint servers were explored, for relevant articles up to December 26, 2020, to identify studies which reported on mortality and/or morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing early versus late intubation. “Early” was defined as intubation within 24 h from intensive care unit (ICU) admission, while “late” as intubation at any time after 24 h of ICU admission. All-cause mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratio (RR), pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222147). A total of 12 studies, involving 8944 critically ill patients with COVID-19, were included. There was no statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality between patients undergoing early versus late intubation (3981 deaths; 45.4% versus 39.1%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99–1.15, p = 0.08). This was also the case for duration of MV (1892 patients; MD − 0.58 days, 95% CI − 3.06 to 1.89 days, p = 0.65). In a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of early/late intubation, intubation without versus with a prior trial of high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive mechanical ventilation was still not associated with a statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality (1128 deaths; 48.9% versus 42.5%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99–1.25, p = 0.08). The synthesized evidence suggests that timing of intubation may have no effect on mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients with COVID-19. These results might justify a wait-and-see approach, which may lead to fewer intubations. Relevant guidelines may therefore need to be updated.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,1,True,True,False,False,True,,,,,A,High,,general,none,13.0
,,Protocol for a systematic review of autologous fat grafting for wound healing,Systematic Reviews,2018.0,"BackgroundAutologous fat grafting is an emerging therapeutic option for cutaneous wounds. The regenerative potential of autologous fat relates to the presence of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) within the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). ADSCs are capable of differentiating into fibroblasts and keratinocytes, as well as secreting soluble mediators with angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the wound healing literature in humans. This systematic review aims to critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous fat grafting in acute and chronic cutaneous wounds with an appraisal of the quality of evidence available.MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases will be searched from inception to December 2017. All primary clinical studies in which wounds are treated with lipotransfer, cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL), SVF products or isolated ADSCs will be eligible for inclusion. Study screening and data extraction will be conducted by two authors in duplicate. Our primary outcome measure will be the proportion of completely healed wounds at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures will include the proportion of partially healed wounds at 12 weeks; the mean wound surface area reduction at 12 weeks; the mean time to wound healing; and adverse event rates. The quality of evidence for each summary outcome measure will be assessed using the GRADE approach.DiscussionIn light of the growing popularity of autologous fat grafting for wound healing, a systematic appraisal of the available evidence is timely. If autologous fat grafting is associated with a positive treatment effect, we will compare these outcomes to those achieved using alternative wound management strategies. This review also aims to determine if one or more autologous fat grafting techniques are superior and whether this varies according to patient- and wound-specific factors. We anticipate that these results will guide future research and inform clinical practice.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO CRD42017081499",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,6.0
,,Moving from bytes to bedside: a systematic review on the use of artificial intelligence in the intensive care unit,Intensive Care Medicine,2021.0,"Due to the increasing demand for intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, and to improve quality and efficiency of care, there is a need for adequate and efficient clinical decision-making. The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has resulted in the development of prediction models, which might aid clinical decision-making. This systematic review seeks to give a contemporary overview of the current maturity of AI in the ICU, the research methods behind these studies, and the risk of bias in these studies. A systematic search was conducted in Embase, Medline, Web of Science Core Collection and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify eligible studies. Studies using AI to analyze ICU data were considered eligible. Specifically, the study design, study aim, dataset size, level of validation, level of readiness, and the outcomes of clinical trials were extracted. Risk of bias in individual studies was evaluated by the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). Out of 6455 studies identified through literature search, 494 were included. The most common study design was retrospective [476 studies (96.4% of all studies)] followed by prospective observational [8 (1.6%)] and clinical [10 (2%)] trials. 378 (80.9%) retrospective studies were classified as high risk of bias. No studies were identified that reported on the outcome evaluation of an AI model integrated in routine clinical practice. The vast majority of developed ICU-AI models remain within the testing and prototyping environment; only a handful were actually evaluated in clinical practice. A uniform and structured approach can support the development, safe delivery, and implementation of AI to determine clinical benefit in the ICU.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,1,True,True,False,True,True,,,,,A,High,,general,none,17.0
,,Local Treatment of Wound Infections: A Review of Clinical Trials from 2013 to 2024.,Advances in wound care,2024.0,"Significance: Management of infection is a critical aspect of wound care. It involves the application of various interventions to treat the wound and prevent the infection from spreading to other parts of the body, which may lead to serious complications, including sepsis. Local treatment of skin wound infections is the favored route of administration, reducing the risk of adverse systemic effects while providing very high therapeutic concentrations at the target site. The purpose of this article was to review clinical trials from 2013 and onward, focusing on local treatment of acute wounds and burns as well as chronic wounds as their primary outcome measurement. Recent Advances: Based on our literature search, 49 clinical trials were focusing on treating infected chronic wounds, and 6 trials studied infection as their primary outcome in acute wounds during the last 10 years. Critical Issues: Currently commercially available local treatments do not prevent the onset of invasive infection. Therefore, there is a need for more effective local therapies. Future Directions: Despite multiple preclinical studies introducing novel and promising strategies in terms of novel antimicrobial agents and delivery methods to prevent and treat skin wound infections locally, many have yet to be tested in a clinical setting. These preclinically tested approaches could still be valuable additions to today's care of infected skin wounds.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,4,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,antimicrobial,12.0

,,Risk factors for pressure injury development in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit: a systematic review protocol,Systematic Reviews,2017.0,"BackgroundPressure injuries (PIs) create a significant burden in the health care system. Up to 49% of critically ill patients develop PIs. Identifying and understanding potential risk factors is essential to the provision of effective targeted prevention strategies to mitigate risk. The objectives of this review are to identify patient-centred clinical factors that may be associated with PI development in the adult intensive care environment and to determine the effect size of the relationship between identified factors and PI development in this unique population.Method/designThe review will follow the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews. Electronic databases (Cochrane; PubMed/MEDLINE; CINAHL (EBSCOhost); Embase; Scopus; PsycINFO; Proquest; Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations; Australian Digital Theses Program, Grey literature, Google scholar, and Clinical Trial Registries) will be systematically searched. A suite of search terms will identify articles that have examined the patient-centred risk factors for PI development in adult intensive care units. The search strategy will be designed to retrieve studies published since inception to 2016 in English language. Quality of the studies will be assessed by using an assessment framework designed to appraise quality in prognostic studies and methodological considerations in the analysis and publication of observational studies. Screening, study selection process, and data extraction will be undertaken by two independent reviewers. Disagreement will be resolved by discussion and, if required, a third independent reviewer.

,,Self-determination theory interventions versus usual care in people with diabetes: a protocol for a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis,Systematic Reviews,2020.0,"Background Existing self-management and behavioural interventions for diabetes vary widely in their content, and their sustained long-term effectiveness is uncertain. Autonomy supporting interventions may be a prerequisite to achieve ‘real life’ patient engagement and more long-term improvement through shared decision-making and collaborative goal setting. Autonomy supportive interventions aim to promote that the person with diabetes’ motivation is autonomous meaning that the person strives for goals they themselves truly believe in and value. This is the goal of self-determination theory and guided self-determination interventions. Self-determination theory has been reviewed but without assessing both benefits and harms and accounting for the risk of random errors using trial sequential analysis. The guided self-determination has not yet been systematically reviewed. The aim of this protocol is to investigate the benefits and harms of self-determination theory-based interventions versus usual care in adults with diabetes. Methods/design We will conduct the systematic review following The Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. This protocol is reported according to the PRISMA checklist. A comprehensive search will be undertaken in the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, SCI-EXPANDED, CINAHL, SSCI, CPCI-S and CPCI-SSH to identify relevant trials. We will include randomised clinical trials assessing interventions theoretically based on guided self-determination or self-determination theory provided face-to-face or digitally by any healthcare professional in any setting. The primary outcomes will be quality of life, mortality, and serious adverse events. The secondary will be diabetes distress, depressive symptoms and adverse events not considered serious. Exploratory outcomes will be glycated haemoglobin and motivation. Outcomes will be assessed at the end of the intervention and at maximum follow-up. The analyses will be performed using Stata version 16 and trial sequential analysis. Two authors will independently screen, extract data from and perform risk of bias assessment of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Certainty of the evidence will be assessed by GRADE. Discussion Self-determination theory interventions aim to promote a more autonomous patient engagement and are commonly used. It is therefore needed to evaluate the benefit and harms according to existing trials.

,,COVID-19 and its cardiovascular effects: a systematic review of prevalence studies.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2021.0,"BACKGROUND
A small minority of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a severe illness, characterised by inflammation, microvascular damage and coagulopathy, potentially leading to myocardial injury, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial occlusive events. People with risk factors for or pre-existing cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities associated with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a variety of settings, including the community, care homes and hospitals. We also assessed the nature and rate of subsequent cardiovascular complications and clinical events in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.


SEARCH METHODS
We conducted an electronic search from December 2019 to 24 July 2020 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, covid-19.cochrane.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trial Register.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before-and-after, case-control and cross-sectional studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed controlled trials as cohorts, disregarding treatment allocation. We only included peer-reviewed studies with 100 or more participants, and excluded articles not written in English or only published in pre-print servers.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two review authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Given substantial variation in study designs, reported outcomes and outcome metrics, we undertook a narrative synthesis of data, without conducting a meta-analysis. We critically appraised all included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies and the JBI checklist for case series.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI's critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI's checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5 We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%)  are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID-19, and are associated with an increased risk of death. In those admitted to hospital, biomarkers of cardiac stress or injury are often abnormal, and the incidence of a wide range of cardiovascular complications is substantial, particularly arrhythmias (22 studies, n = 13,115, weighted mean incidence (WMI) 9.3%), heart failure (20 studies, n = 29,317, WMI: 6.8%) and thrombotic complications (VTE: 16 studies, n = 7700, WMI: 7.4%).


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
This systematic literature review indicates that cardiometabolic comorbidities are common in people who are hospitalised with a COVID-19 infection, and cardiovascular complications are frequent. We plan to update this review and to conduct a formal meta-analysis of outcomes based on a more homogeneous selected subsample of high-certainty studies.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,2,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,True,,,,,A,High,,infection,none,15.0
,,Noninvasive respiratory support outside the intensive care unit for acute respiratory failure related to coronavirus-19 disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Critical Care,2021.0,"Noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS) has been diffusely employed outside the intensive care unit (ICU) to face the high request of ventilatory support due to the massive influx of patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) caused by coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). We sought to summarize the evidence on clinically relevant outcomes in COVID-19 patients supported by NIV outside the ICU. We searched PUBMED®, EMBASE®, and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical trials register, along with medRxiv and bioRxiv repositories for pre-prints, for observational studies and randomized controlled trials, from inception to the end of February 2021. Two authors independently selected the investigations according to the following criteria: (1) observational study or randomized clinical trials enrolling ≥ 50 hospitalized patients undergoing NIRS outside the ICU, (2) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and (3) at least the intra-hospital mortality reported. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines were followed. Data extraction was independently performed by two authors to assess: investigation features, demographics and clinical characteristics, treatments employed, NIRS regulations, and clinical outcomes. Methodological index for nonrandomized studies tool was applied to determine the quality of the enrolled studies. The primary outcome was to assess the overall intra-hospital mortality of patients under NIRS outside the ICU. The secondary outcomes included the proportions intra-hospital mortalities of patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation following NIRS failure and of those with ‘do-not-intubate’ (DNI) orders. Seventeen investigations (14 peer-reviewed and 3 pre-prints) were included with a low risk of bias and a high heterogeneity, for a total of 3377 patients. The overall intra-hospital mortality of patients receiving NIRS outside the ICU was 36% [30–41%]. 26% [21–30%] of the patients failed NIRS and required intubation, with an intra-hospital mortality rising to 45% [36–54%]. 23% [15–32%] of the patients received DNI orders with an intra-hospital mortality of 72% [65–78%]. Oxygenation on admission was the main source of between-study heterogeneity. During COVID-19 outbreak, delivering NIRS outside the ICU revealed as a feasible strategy to cope with the massive demand of ventilatory assistance.

,,The impact of wearable continuous vital sign monitoring on deterioration detection and clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Critical Care,2021.0,"Background Timely recognition of the deteriorating inpatient remains challenging. Wearable monitoring systems (WMS) may augment current monitoring practices. However, there are many barriers to implementation in the hospital environment, and evidence describing the clinical impact of WMS on deterioration detection and patient outcome remains unclear. Objective To assess the impact of vital-sign monitoring on detection of deterioration and related clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients using WMS, in comparison with standard care. Methods A systematic search was conducted in August 2020 using MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, Health Technology Assessment databases and grey literature. Studies comparing the use of WMS against standard care for deterioration detection and related clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients were included. Deterioration related outcomes (primary) included unplanned intensive care admissions, rapid response team or cardiac arrest activation, total and major complications rate. Other clinical outcomes (secondary) included in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay. Exploratory outcomes included alerting system parameters and clinical trial registry information. Results Of 8706 citations, 10 studies with different designs met the inclusion criteria, of which 7 were included in the meta-analyses. Overall study quality was moderate. The meta-analysis indicated that the WMS, when compared with standard care, was not associated with significant reductions in intensive care transfers (risk ratio, RR 0.87; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.66–1.15), rapid response or cardiac arrest team activation (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69–1.01), total (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.44–1.32) and major (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.24–1.30) complications prevalence. There was also no statistically significant association with reduced mortality (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.18–1.29) and hospital length of stay (mean difference, MD − 0.09; 95% CI − 0.43 to 0.44). Conclusion This systematic review indicates that there is no current evidence that implementation of WMS impacts early deterioration detection and associated clinical outcomes, as differing design/quality of available studies and diversity of outcome measures make it difficult to reach a definite conclusion. Our narrative findings suggested that alarms should be adjusted to minimise false alarms and promote rapid clinical action in response to deterioration.

We assessed methodological characteristics and describe the quality of reporting using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.ResultsWe retrieved 107 studies. The most common medical field studied was oncology, and 43.9% of trials evaluated pharmacological interventions. Symptom control and physical dimensions (e.g. intervention on pain, breathlessness, nausea) were the palliative care-specific issues most studied. We found under-reporting of key information in particular on random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding.ConclusionsWhile the number of clinical trials in palliative care has increased over time, methodological quality remains suboptimal.

,,Wound management provided by advanced practice nurses: a scoping review,JBI Evidence Synthesis,2023.0,"Objective: The objective of the review was to map the similarities and differences in the wound care practices of nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and advanced practice registered nurses, globally. Introduction: Advanced practice nurses have graduate education and advanced scope of practice. Adding advanced wound care training to their skill set provides an opportunity for advanced practice nurses to provide wound care. Inclusion criteria: This review considered for inclusion studies of advanced practice nurses globally who are registered nurses with graduate-level education and advanced training (certification/education) in wound care in any setting. Methods: The review was conducted using JBI methodology for scoping reviews. The databases searched included MEDLINE, CINAHL, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. To reflect changes in the advanced practice nursing scope of practice, searches were limited to articles published from 2011 onward. Articles in languages other than English were translated. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles and abstracts; relevant sources were retrieved in full and screened for eligibility against the inclusion criteria. An additional independent reviewer resolved any disagreements. Data were extracted using a data extraction tool. Extracted data included similarities and differences in wound care practice (type of wound, practice setting, treatments). Results: There were 2504 abstracts screened, and 158 articles were screened at full text. Seven articles were included in this review: 3 sources from the United States, 2 from Australia, and 1 each from Canada and The Netherlands. All 7 sources focused on nurse practitioners. Wound care education varied from certification in wound ostomy to a master’s education in wounds. The practice setting varied; there were 2 primary care clinics, 2 community clinics, a wound care center; a suburban hospital, and a study that included tertiary, community, and residential care. Treatments varied, but the sources specific to pressure injuries discussed assessments, cleansing, dressings, topical products, and offloading surfaces/equipment. One source examined the impact of hiring nurse practitioners as wound care consultants. Sources that discussed treatments for various wounds described comprehensive assessments, diagnostic investigations, referrals, wound management, and medications prescribed. Conclusions: This review outlined the characteristics of advanced practice nurses providing wound care and their practice settings, types of wounds, and treatments provided. Many articles on advanced practice nurses with advanced wound care expertise lack a description of the graduate-level education and/or the specifics regarding wound care certification. This prevents comparison of advanced practice nurses with each other and with other providers regarding the impact that advanced practice nurses have on the health care system in relation to wound care, including cost, access to services, and patient satisfaction.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0
,,Percentage area reduction as surrogate for complete healing of hard-to-heal wounds: a review of clinical trials,Journal of Wound Care,2024.0,"Hard-to-heal (chronic) wounds are treated differently at varying healing stages and often require long periods of time to heal completely. Therefore, it is often very difficult to achieve this primary endpoint in clinical trials with wound products which are used temporarily. Thus, it seems reasonable to use valid wound healing parameters determined at an early stage, such as the percentage (wound) area reduction (PAR), as surrogates for predicting complete wound healing. To identify studies on the association between potential surrogate endpoints and complete wound healing, a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases was performed. The findings of the studies were summarised qualitatively. A total of 23 publications with a focus on hard-to-heal wounds (n=10 diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), n=10 venous leg ulcers (VLUs), n=3 other ulcers) and various wound care regimens were identified. All studies showed a high bias potential. The available clinical evidence confirmed that the PAR at week 4 showed a good discriminatory capacity to predict which wounds would eventually heal and which would not. The chance to achieve complete wound healing was significantly higher for wounds achieving a PAR of ≥40% (VLU) or ≥50% (DFU) at week 4. The PAR thresholds of 40% (VLU) and 50% (DFU) can be used to identify the proportion of the wounds that will heal, and those that will not heal, to compare the efficacy of different wound dressings as early as week 4 in the setting of clinical trials.

,,Patient education for preventing recurrence of venous leg ulcers: a systematic review.,Journal of wound care,2020.0,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the impact of patient education interventions on preventing the recurrence of venous leg ulcers (VLU).


METHOD
A systematic review was undertaken using the following databases: Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library); Ovid; Ovid (In-process and Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL. Trial registries and reference lists of relevant publications for published and ongoing trials were also searched. There were no language or publication date restrictions. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs of patient educational interventions for preventing VLU recurrence were included. Review authors working independently assessed trials for their appropriateness for inclusion and for their risk of bias, using pre-determined inclusion and quality criteria.


RESULTS
A total of four studies met the inclusion criteria (274 participants). Each trial explored different interventions as follows: the Lively legs programme; education delivered via a video compared with education delivered via a pamphlet; the Leg Ulcer Prevention Programme and the Lindsay Leg Club. Only one study reported the primary outcome of incidence of VLU recurrence. All studies reported at least one of the secondary outcomes: patient behaviours, patient knowledge and patient quality of life (QoL). It is uncertain whether patient education programmes make any difference to VLU recurrence at 18 months (risk ratio [RR]: 0.82; 95% confidence interval: [CI] 0.59 to 1.14) or to patient behaviours (walked at least 10 minutes/five days a week RR: 1.48; 95%CI: 0.99 to 2.21; walked at least 30 minutes/five days a week: RR 1.14; 95%CI: 0.66 to 1.98; performed leg exercises: RR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.04 to 2.09); to knowledge scores (MD (mean difference) 5.12, 95% CI -1.54 to 11.78); or to QoL (MD: 0.85, 95% CI -0.13 to 1.83), as the certainty of evidence has been assessed as very low. It is also uncertain whether different types of education delivery make any difference to knowledge scores (MD: 12.40; 95%CI: -5.68 to 30.48). Overall, GRADE assessments of the evidence resulted predominantly in judgments of very low certainty. The studies were at high risk of bias and outcome measures were imprecise due to wide CIs and small sample sizes.


CONCLUSION
It is uncertain whether education makes any difference to the prevention of VLU recurrence. Therefore, further well-designed trials, addressing important clinical, QoL and economic outcomes are justified, based on the incidence of the problem and the high costs associated with VLU management.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,12.0

A systematic search was performed on international electronic databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science, as well as on Iranian electronic databases such as Iranmedex and Scientific Information Database (SID) with keywords extracted from Medical Subject Headings such as ‘Burns’, ‘Bandages’, ‘Pain’, ‘Pain management’, ‘Anxiety’, ‘Breathing’, and ‘Breathing exercise’, which were performed from the earliest to 4 April 2022. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist assessed the quality of randomised control trials (RCTs) and quasi‐experimental studies. The current meta‐analysis was performed using STATA V.14.0 software. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to determine significance levels. Random effect model was used to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD). A total of 469 burn patients participated in 10 studies. Exactly 58.60% of burn patients were male, and the number of people in the intervention and control groups was equal. The mean age of burn patients was 32.84 (SD = 10.39). Exactly 78.05% of patients had second‐degree burns. The mean study duration was 19 weeks. Results of analysis of RCT studies showed BET decreased insignificantly pain severity (WMD: −1.17, 95%CI: −2.54 to 0.21, Z = 1.66, P = .096, I2:97.1%) in the intervention group than control group. However, the results of non‐RCTs studies indicated BET significantly decreased pain (WMD: −1.38, 95%CI: −2.16 to −0.61, Z = 3.49, P < .001, I2:88.4%) and anxiety (WMD: −4.91, 95%CI: −9.35 to −0.47, Z = 2.71, P = .03 0.001, I2:88.4%) in the intervention group than control group. Overall, the results of RCTs found BET intervention decreased pain in the intervention group when compared with the control group; however, it was statistically insignificant. Also, results of non‐RCT studies showed intervention of BET significantly decreased pain and anxiety in burns patients.

,,Effects of Rehabilitation Interventions on Clinical Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials*,Critical Care Medicine,2020.0,"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Objectives: To assess the impact of rehabilitation in ICU on clinical outcomes. Data Sources: Secondary data analysis of randomized controlled trials published between 1998 and October 2019 was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Study Selection: We have selected trials investigating neuromuscular electrical stimulation or cycling exercises or protocolized physical rehabilitation as compared to standard of care in critically ill adults. Data Extraction: Mortality, length of stay in ICU and at hospital, days on mechanical ventilator, and adverse events. Data Synthesis: We found 43 randomized controlled trials (nine on cycling, 14 on neuromuscular electrical stimulation alone and 20 on protocolized physical rehabilitation) into which 3,548 patients were randomized and none of whom experienced an intervention-related serious adverse event. The exercise interventions had no influence on mortality (odds ratio 0.94 [0.79–1.12], n = 38 randomized controlled trials) but reduced duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, –1.7 d [–2.5 to –0.8 d], n = 32, length of stay in ICU (–1.2 d [–2.5 to 0.0 d], n = 32) but not at hospital (–1.6 [–4.3 to 1.2 d], n = 23). The effects on the length of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay were only significant for the protocolized physical rehabilitation subgroup and enhanced in patients with longer ICU stay and lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. There was no benefit of early start of the intervention. It is likely that the dose of rehabilitation delivered was much lower than dictated by the protocol in many randomized controlled trials and negative results may reflect the failure to implement the intervention. Conclusions: Rehabilitation interventions in critically ill patients do not influence mortality and are safe. Protocolized physical rehabilitation significantly shortens time spent on mechanical ventilation and in ICU, but this does not consistently translate into long-term functional benefit. Stable patients with lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II at admission (<20) and prone to protracted ICU stay may benefit most from rehabilitation interventions.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,10.0

,,Benefits of sucrose octasulfate (TLC-NOSF) dressings in the treatment of chronic wounds: a systematic review.,Journal of wound care,2021.0,"OBJECTIVE
Management of chronic wounds remains one of the major challenges for health professionals and patients. An evidence-based decision is important to ensure that patients are receiving the best treatment proven to reduce healing time and improve outcomes, including economic benefits and patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Due to recent restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including closure of wound care centres within hospitals and a drop in patient volume, chronic wound management needs simple-to-use dressings which are still effective and evidence-based solutions. This systematic review was conducted to identify the clinical evidence available on a sucrose octasulfate dressing (TLC-NOSF, UrgoStart dressing range, Laboratoires Urgo, France) to explore its efficacy in the management of chronic wounds, particularly lower limb ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers.


METHOD
A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar was conducted based on the PICO model (patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes) to retrieve publications of different levels of evidence in order to evaluate outcomes of the use of TLC-NOSF dressings.


RESULTS
A total of 21 publications of different levels, ranging from double-blind randomised control trials to case reports, involving over 12,000 patients, were identified through PubMed, with a further eight publications through Google Scholar and two publications through Cochrane Library. A total of seven results were omitted due to the lack of relevance or repetition.


CONCLUSION
All the evidence provided suggest that these dressings provide clinicians with an evidence-based option for the management of chronic wounds; that the TLC-NOSF dressings are beneficial in promoting the healing process, reducing healing times, enhancing patients' HRQoL, and in allowing a more cost-effective procedure.",Semantic Scholar,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,9.0
,,Telemedicine with clinical decision support for critical care: a systematic review,Systematic Reviews,2016.0,"BackgroundTelemedicine applications aim to address variance in clinical outcomes and increase access to specialist expertise. Despite widespread implementation, there is little robust evidence about cost-effectiveness, clinical benefits, and impact on quality and safety of critical care telemedicine. The primary objective was to determine the impact of critical care telemedicine (with clinical decision support available 24/7) on intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality and length of stay in adults and children. The secondary objectives included staff and patient experience, costs, protocol adherence, and adverse events.MethodsData sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library databases, Health Technology Assessment Database, Web of Science, OpenGrey, OpenDOAR, and the HMIC through to December 2015. Randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were eligible for inclusion. Eligible studies reported on differences between groups using the telemedicine intervention and standard care. Two review authors screened abstracts and assessed potentially eligible studies using Cochrane guidance.ResultsTwo controlled before-after studies met the inclusion criteria. Both were assessed as high risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible as we were unable to disaggregate data between the two studies. One study used a non-randomised stepped-wedge design in seven ICUs. Hospital mortality was the primary outcome which showed a reduction from 13.6 % (CI, 11.9–15.4 %) to 11.8 % (CI, 10.9–12.8 %) during the intervention period with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.40 (95 % CI, 0.31–0.52; p = .005). The second study used a non-randomised, unblinded, pre-/post-assessment of telemedicine interventions in 56 adult ICUs. Hospital mortality (primary outcome) reduced from 11 to 10 % (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.84; CI, 0.78–0.89; p = <.001).ConclusionsThis review highlights the poor methodological quality of most studies investigating critical care telemedicine. The results of the two included studies showed a reduction in hospital mortality in patients receiving the intervention.

,,Impact on Patient Outcomes of Pharmacist Participation in Multidisciplinary Critical Care Teams: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Critical Care Medicine,2019.0,"OBJECTIVES
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effects of including critical care pharmacists in multidisciplinary ICU teams on clinical outcomes including mortality, ICU length of stay, and adverse drug events.


DATA SOURCES
PubMed, EMBASE, and references from previous relevant systematic studies.


STUDY SELECTION
We included randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies that reported clinical outcomes such as mortality, ICU length of stay, and adverse drug events in groups with and without critical care pharmacist interventions.


DATA EXTRACTION
We extracted study details, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes.


DATA SYNTHESIS
From the 4,725 articles identified as potentially eligible, 14 were included in the analysis. Intervention of critical care pharmacists as part of the multidisciplinary ICU team care was significantly associated with the reduced likelihood of mortality (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.83; p < 0.00001) compared with no intervention. The mean difference in ICU length of stay was -1.33 days (95% CI, -1.75 to -0.90 d; p < 0.00001) for mixed ICUs. The reduction of adverse drug event prevalence was also significantly associated with multidisciplinary team care involving pharmacist intervention (odds ratio for preventable and nonpreventable adverse drug events, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15-0.44; p < 0.00001 and odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28-0.77; p = 0.003, respectively).

Background Patient experience of health care is sensitive to nursing quality. A refocus on fundamental nursing care is undermined by lack of evidence of effectiveness for interventions in core areas such as elimination, nutrition, mobility and hygiene. Design Systematic review. Methods We searched for and included experimental studies on interventions by professionally qualified and unregistered nurses that addressed participants' nutrition, elimination, mobility and hygiene needs. We extracted data on scope, quality and results of studies followed by descriptive narrative synthesis of included study outcomes using a novel form of harvest plots. Results We included 149 studies, 35 nutrition, 56 elimination, 16 mobility, 39 hygiene and three addressing two or more areas simultaneously (67 randomised controlled trials, 32 non‐randomised controlled trials and 50 uncontrolled trials). Studies into interventions on participant self‐management of nutrition (n = 25), oral health (n = 26), catheter care (n = 23) and self‐management of elimination (n = 21) were the most prevalent. Most studies focussed their outcomes on observational or physiological measures, with very few collecting patient‐reported outcomes, such as quality of life, experience or self‐reported symptoms. All but 13 studies were of low quality and at significant risk of bias. The majority of studies did not define primary outcomes, included multiple measures of identical concepts, used inappropriate analyses and did not conform to standard reporting quality criteria. Conclusions The current evidence for fundamental nursing care interventions is sparse, of poor quality and unfit to provide evidence‐based guidance to practising nurses.

,,The impact of frailty on intensive care unit outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Intensive Care Medicine,2017.0,"PurposeFunctional status and chronic health status are important baseline characteristics of critically ill patients. The assessment of frailty on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) may provide objective, prognostic information on baseline health. To determine the impact of frailty on the outcome of critically ill patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing clinical outcomes in frail and non-frail patients admitted to ICU.MethodsWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Clinicaltrials.gov. All study designs with the exception of narrative reviews, case reports, and editorials were included. Included studies assessed frailty in patients greater than 18 years of age admitted to an ICU and compared outcomes between fit and frail patients. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed quality, and extracted data. The primary outcomes were hospital and long-term mortality. We also determined the prevalence of frailty, the impact on other patient-centered outcomes such as discharge disposition, and health service utilization such as length of stay.ResultsTen observational studies enrolling a total of 3030 patients (927 frail and 2103 fit patients) were included. The overall quality of studies was moderate. Frailty was associated with higher hospital mortality [relative risk (RR) 1.71; 95% CI 1.43, 2.05; p < 0.00001; I2 = 32%] and long-term mortality (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.40, 1.68; p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%). The pooled prevalence of frailty was 30% (95% CI 29–32%). Frail patients were less likely to be discharged home than fit patients (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.49, 0.71; p < 0.00001; I2 = 12%).ConclusionsFrailty is common in patients admitted to ICU and is associated with worsened outcomes.

In order to overcome the limitations of traditional methods of treatment, namely the type of equipment, its setting, safety and cost, local haemoglobin therapy has been developed, although no reviews have so far been published. Here, we systematically review the current evidence to establish the efficacy, scope, adverse reactions, and required precautions of this new form of therapy. A search of the literature was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Web of science databases, with 17 studies meeting the eligibility criteria, comprising one animal model study and 16 clinical studies. Local haemoglobin therapy is able to safely and effectively promote the healing of a variety of wounds, especially those that are chronic and non‐healing. However, premature discontinuation of this treatment can result in impediment to wound healing and even deterioration of the wound. The distinct benefit of the elimination of slough and relief of pain suggests that this technique may represent a new generation of debridement technology.

Electronic search of PubMed, Scopus, PEDro and Google Scholar databases was conducted. The revised tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials (RoB 2), the risk of bias in non‐randomised studies‐of interventions (ROBINS‐I) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool were used to assess risk of bias and methodological quality. Overall quality of evidence was determined using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) principles. Thirty‐two studies matched the eligibility criteria, and included 1061 patients with 1103 skin lesions of selected aetiologies; 12 randomised controlled trials were included in quantitative synthesis. HVMPC plus standard wound care (SWC) likely increased the probability of complete wound healing of pressure ulcers (PrUs) compared with sham/no stimulation plus SWC; relative risk (RR) 2.08; 95% CI: [1.42, 3.04], p = 0.0002; I2 = 0%, p = 0.61; eight studies, 358 ulcers. Although conclusive evidence regarding the effect of HVMPC on diabetic ulcers was not found, collateral evidence might suggest a potential benefit. Direct evidence, with moderate certainty, may support its efficacy in treating PrUs, albeit few adverse reactions were reported.

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate whether the application of laser therapy improved alveolar healing after tooth extractions. Eight electronic databases were screened: MedLine (PubMed), The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, Ibecs, Scielo, and BBO. Three reviewers independently assessed the title and abstracts of potentially relevant studies.

Although HF, Diode and GaAs lasers were able to enhance wound healing process in clinical studies, four trials and one animal experiment showed no improvement in wound healing with laser therapy after tooth extractions. In general, the current available evidence in the literature showed that laser therapy improved the wound healing process, but these findings were limited to the type of laser applied and its specific settings.

,10.1002/dmrr.3644,Guidelines on interventions to enhance healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes (IWGDF 2023 update),Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews,2023.0,"Abstract Aims Principles of wound management, including debridement, wound bed preparation, and newer technologies involving alternation of wound physiology to facilitate healing, are of utmost importance when attempting to heal a chronic diabetes‐related foot ulcer. However, the rising incidence and costs of diabetes‐related foot ulcer management necessitate that interventions to enhance wound healing of chronic diabetes‐related foot ulcers are supported by high‐quality evidence of efficacy and cost effectiveness when used in conjunction with established aspects of gold‐standard multidisciplinary care. This is the 2023 International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) evidence‐based guideline on wound healing interventions to promote healing of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes. It serves as an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline. Materials and Methods We followed the GRADE approach by devising clinical questions and important outcomes in the Patient‐Intervention‐Control‐Outcome (PICO) format, undertaking a systematic review, developing summary of judgements tables, and writing recommendations and rationale for each question. Each recommendation is based on the evidence found in the systematic review and, using the GRADE summary of judgement items, including desirable and undesirable effects, certainty of evidence, patient values, resources required, cost effectiveness, equity, feasibility, and acceptability, we formulated recommendations that were agreed by the authors and reviewed by independent experts and stakeholders. Results From the results of the systematic review and evidence‐to‐decision making process, we were able to make 29 separate recommendations. We made a number of conditional supportive recommendations for the use of interventions to improve healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. These include the use of sucrose octasulfate dressings, the use of negative pressure wound therapies for post‐operative wounds, the use of placental‐derived products, the use of the autologous leucocyte/platelet/fibrin patch, the use of topical oxygen therapy, and the use of hyperbaric oxygen. Although in all cases it was stressed that these should be used where best standard of care was not able to heal the wound alone and where resources were available for the interventions. Conclusions These wound healing recommendations should support improved outcomes for people with diabetes and ulcers of the foot, and we hope that widescale implementation will follow. However, although the certainty of much of the evidence on which to base the recommendations is improving, it remains poor overall.

,,The evidence and the rationale for the use of honey as a wound dressing,Wound Practice & Research: Journal of the Australian Wound Management Association,2011.0,"Although there are now several brands and types of honey wound-care products available as registered medical devices, there is little promotional advertising of honey products for wound care. The misconception that there is no evidence to support the use of honey, which seems to be quite common, may be due to this lack of advertising, and to the systematic reviews that have been published on honey concluding that the evidence is of low quality and/or there is a need for more evidence. However, the same lack of high-quality evidence exists with all the other options that clinicians have for dressing wounds. This places practitioners in a quandary. When clinical evidence of the highest level is not available, then decisions on modes of treatment need to be based on whatever evidence there is available. This review outlines the 16 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of honey in wound care published since Molan reviewed the previous 17 in 2006, which bring the total of participants in the trials up from 1,965 to 3,556 and broadens the range of types of wounds on which trials with honey have been conducted. Another important factor influencing the choice by clinicians of which product to use on a wound is scientific rationale. This review covers the evidence and explanation of mode of action for various bioactivities in honey which aid wound healing: a very broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that is effective on antibiotic-resistant strains; activation of autolytic debridement; anti-inflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; stimulation of growth of cells for tissue repair; and an osmotic action. The need for standardisation of these bioactivities is discussed.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,1,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,antimicrobial,none,9.0

,10.1111/wrr.12391,WHS guidelines update: Diabetic foot ulcer treatment guidelines,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2015.0,"There are 22.3 million people in the United States with diabetes, of whom 15–25% are at risk for foot ulceration. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a growing health problem. DFUs are a leading cause of infection, amputation, and hospitalization in patients with diabetes mellitus. Guidelines for the treatment of DFUs were published by the Wound Healing Society (WHS) in 2006. However, in the past few years new evidence has emerged that improves our understanding of previous recommendations. The objectives of the WHS DFU guidelines are to systematically evaluate the medical literature to assist clinicians in making health care decisions, identify areas that need additional research, and to clarify controversial diagnosis and treatment strategies. An advisory panel comprised of academicians, clinicians, researchers, and industry representatives was chosen to update the 2006 guidelines. In 2006, in an effort to develop guidelines that could provide clinicians with a reasonable approach to caring for patients, even in the absence of high quality human data, the WHS developed guidelines using a different approach to evidence citations and past approaches to evidence-based guidelines. Most past approaches relied only on publications regarding clinical human studies. Laboratory or animal studies were not cited. We have used well-controlled animal studies that present proof of principle, especially when a clinical series corroborated the laboratory results. Because of this variation, a different system was used to grade the weight of evidence supporting a given guideline. The strength of evidence supporting a guideline is listed as Level I, Level II, or Level III. Since the 2006 guidelines, we sought to capture the highest quality of literature available regarding DFU diagnosis and treatment using a key word search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Similarly, the citations of relevant articles were examined by hand. Key terms were generated from the existing guidelines. In this search as opposed to the previous data collection prior to 2006, we used human and disease specific data and limited to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, RCTs, retrospective series reviews, clinical case series, and expert panel recommendations published between January 2006 and present. References prior to 2006 supporting the original guideline recommendations are not included. Therefore, in some cases no additional updated references were included and the support for the guideline recommendation is based on evidence presented in the 2006 guideline. Therefore, no updated references are presented. It was further limited to only English publications. Any relevant additional references found after the formal search were also included. The findings of these articles have been divided into one or more of the appropriate categories as performed in the original guideline Each of the separate guidelines has undergone a Delphi consensus among the panel members. Not all panel members thought they had sufficient expertise to critique all of the separate sections of the guidelines. The first draft was of the guidelines was presented in 2014 for public comment and subsequent drafts revised based on those comments. Evidence Reference: Preamble: Ulcers of the lower extremity may be caused by a variety of conditions, including neuropathy, ischemia, venous hypertension, and pressure. Patients with diabetes develop wounds secondary to neuropathy with or without biomechanical abnormalities, peripheral vascular disease with ischemia, or both. There are over 20 million people in the United States with diabetes, of whom 15–25% are at risk for ulceration. It is imperative that the etiology be established to provide for proper therapy. Guideline #1.1: Clinically significant arterial disease should be ruled out by establishing that pedal pulses are clearly palpable or that the ankle:brachial index (ABI) is > 0.9. An ABI > 1.3 suggests noncompressible arteries. In elderly patients or patients with an ABI > 1.2, a normal Doppler-derived waveform, a toe:brachial index of > 0.7, or a transcutaneous oxygen pressure of > 40 mmHg and/or hyperspectral imaging analysis may help to suggest an adequate arterial flow. Color duplex ultrasound scanning provides anatomic and physiologic data confirming an ischemic etiology for the leg wound. (Level I) Principle: Diabetic ulcers can result from arterial insufficiency or neuropathy. Although clinical history and physical examination can be very suggestive of an ischemic etiology of the lower extremity diabetic ulcers, a definitive diagnosis must be established. When significant arterial disease is present, successful treatment requires that arterial insufficiency be addressed. Updated Evidence: Guideline #1.2: The presence of significant neuropathy can be determined by testing with a 10 g (5.07) Semmes–Weinstein monofilament. (Level II) Principle: Diabetic sensory neuropathy creates an environment in which repetitive trauma, injury and infection are unrecognized by the patient. Several simple clinical techniques can be used to identify sensory neuropathy with loss of protective sensation. The presence of sensory neuropathy can be determined by testing with a 10 g Semmes Weinstein monofilament, 128 Hz tuning fork, vibration perception threshold testing or a good neurological clinical examination for sensory loss. Updated Evidence: Preamble: Diabetic ulcerations on the sole of the foot are often associated with moderate to high pressures because of foot deformity, limited joint mobility, and neuropathy. Off-loading devices reduce pressure on the sole of the foot and often reduce the activity level of the patient. Off-loading the area of high pressure has been the mainstay to heal DFUs and prevent recurrence of foot ulcerations (Level I). Guideline #2.1: Protective footwear should be prescribed in any patient at risk for amputation (significant arterial insufficiency, significant neuropathy, previous amputation, previous ulcer formation, preulcerative callus, foot deformity, evidence of callus formation). (Level II) Protective footwear results in reduction in recurrent ulcerations in high-risk patients with a previous foot ulcer or amputation. (Level I). Principle: The etiology of many foot ulcers involves a biomechanical component. Most treatments do not eliminate the underlying biomechanical etiology of the foot ulcer. Abnormal pressure and shear stress is still present, so long-term off-loading is necessary. By reducing pressure and shear forces on the sole of the foot, repetitive injury to the foot is reduced, and existing wounds can heal or high-risk areas are protected from recurrent ulcers. Updated Evidence: Guideline #2.2: Acceptable methods of offloading include crutches, walkers, wheelchairs, custom",OpenAlex,0,0,2,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,none,12.0

As it decreases the inflammatory response resulting from the extracorporeal circulation, it may have a positive effect on clinical outcomes. This meta-analysis was carried out to examine if heparin-bonded circuits (HBCs) reduce the need for blood products and improve overall clinical outcome. A systematic literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials reporting outcomes of HBCs compared with non-HBCs. Primary outcomes assessed were postoperative blood/blood-product transfusion and blood loss. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, acute postoperative myocardial infarction, stroke, re-sternotomy for postoperative bleeding, wound infection, atrial fibrillation, duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital-length of stay (LOS). Random effects meta-analytical techniques were applied to identify differences in outcomes between the two groups. Quality of the included studies and heterogeneity were assessed. From an initial review of 762-published studies, 41-randomized trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria, leaving 3434-patients' data for analysis. HBCs significantly decreased the incidence of blood transfusion required (OR = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.6:0.9, P = 0.004). It also significantly decreased re-sternotomy (OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4:0.8, P = 0.002), duration of ventilation (WMD = −1.3 h; 95% CI = −1.9:−0.6, P ≪ 0.001), ICU-LOS (WMD = −9.3 h; 95% CI = −14.7:−3.9, P ≪ 0.001) and hospital-LOS (WMD = −0.5 day; 95% CI = −0.9:−0.1, P = 0.02). HBCs had no effect on other adverse events evaluated. Although HBCs showed a positive effect on some of the clinical outcomes, we identified only marginal differences for other outcomes.

The present pragmatic, randomised, prospective open trial evaluated a wound‐specific oral nutrition supplement enriched with arginine, vitamin C and zinc compared to a standard supplement with respect to outcomes in patients with chronic wounds in an acute care setting. Methods Twenty‐four patients [11 males and 13 females; mean (SD) age: 67.8 (22.3) years] with chronic wounds (14 diabetic or venous ulcers; 10 pressure ulcers or chronic surgical wounds) were randomised to receive either a wound‐specific supplement ( n = 12) or standard supplement ( n = 12) for 4 weeks, with ongoing best wound and nutrition care for an additional 4 weeks. At baseline, and at 4 and 8 weeks, the rate of wound‐healing, nutritional status, protein and energy intake, quality of life and product satisfaction were measured. Linear mixed effects modelling with random intercepts and slopes were fitted to determine whether the wound‐specific nutritional supplement had any effect. Results There was a significant improvement in wound‐healing in patients receiving the standard nutrition supplement compared to a wound‐specific supplement ( P = 0.044), although there was no effect on nutritional status, dietary intake, quality of life and patient satisfaction. Conclusions The results of the present study indicate that a standard oral nutrition supplement may be more effective at wound‐healing than a specialised wound supplement in this clinical setting.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,5.0

Plastic surgeons should have evidence-based information available to guide their use of these products. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to determine the published outcomes and effectiveness of different skin substitutes for healing chronic foot ulcers. Methods: A broad literature search of the MEDLINE, EBSCO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was undertaken. Relevant studies were selected by three independent reviewers to include randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews examining the use of skin substitutes on foot ulcers. Results were narrowed further by the application of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were assessed for quality and data were extracted regarding study characteristics and objective outcomes. Results: Of an initial 271 search results, 15 randomized controlled trials, one prospective comparative study, and five systematic reviews were included in the systematic review. Most of the included clinical studies were of moderate to low quality by objective standards, and reported results using cell-based skin substitutes. The primary outcome examined, success rate of complete healing, was equivalent to or better than that of standard therapy for all skin substitutes examined. Conclusions: A convincing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of living cell–based skin substitutes as an adjunctive therapy for increasing the rate of complete healing in chronic foot ulcers when basic tenets of wound care are also being implemented. Acellular skin substitutes also show some promise for treatment of foot wounds but require further study.

,10.1111/1471-0528.15386,Care of Women with Obesity in Pregnancy,BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology,2018.0,"What care should be provided in the primary care setting to women of childbearing age with obesity who wish to become pregnant? Primary care services should ensure that all women of childbearing age have the opportunity to optimise their weight before pregnancy. Advice on weight and lifestyle should be given during preconception counselling or contraceptive consultations. Weight and BMI should be measured to encourage women to optimise their weight before pregnancy. Grade of recommendation: ✓ Women of childbearing age with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should receive information and advice about the risks of obesity during pregnancy and childbirth, and be supported to lose weight before conception and between pregnancies in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical guideline (CG) 189. Grade of recommendation: D Women should be informed that weight loss between pregnancies reduces the risk of stillbirth, hypertensive complications and fetal macrosomia. Weight loss increases the chances of successful vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) section. Grade of recommendation: B What nutritional supplements should be recommended to women with obesity who wish to become pregnant? Women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater wishing to become pregnant should be advised to take 5 mg folic acid supplementation daily, starting at least 1 month before conception and continuing during the first trimester of pregnancy. Grade of recommendation: D Obese women are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. However, although vitamin D supplementation may ensure that women are vitamin D replete, the evidence on whether routine vitamin D should be given to improve maternal and offspring outcomes remains uncertain. Grade of recommendation: B How and where should antenatal care be provided? Care of women with obesity in pregnancy can be integrated into all antenatal clinics, with clear local policies and guidelines for care available. Grade of recommendation: D What are the facilities, equipment, and personnel required? All maternity units should have a documented environmental risk assessment regarding the availability of facilities to care for pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater. This risk assessment should address the following issues: Maternity units should have a central list of all facilities and equipment required to provide safe care to pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater. The list should include details of safe working loads, product dimensions, as well as where specific equipment is located and how to access it. Grade of recommendation: ✓ Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 for whom moving and handling are likely to prove unusually difficult should have a moving and handling risk assessment carried out in the third trimester of pregnancy to determine any requirements for labour and birth. Clear communication of manual handling requirements should occur between the labour and theatre suites when women are in early labour. Grade of recommendation: D Some women with a booking BMI less than 40 kg/m2 or greater may also benefit from assessment of moving and handling requirements in the third trimester. This should be decided on an individual basis. Grade of recommendation: ✓ When and how often should maternal weight, height and BMI be measured? All pregnant women should have their weight and height measured using appropriate equipment, and their BMI calculated at the antenatal booking visit. Measurements should be recorded in the handheld notes and electronic patient information system. Grade of recommendation: D For women with obesity in pregnancy, consideration should be given to reweighing women during the third trimester to allow appropriate plans to be made for equipment and personnel required during labour and birth. Grade of recommendation: ✓ What is the acceptable gestational weight gain in obese women? There is a lack of consensus on optimal gestational weight gain. Until further evidence is available, a focus on a healthy diet may be more applicable than prescribed weight gain targets. Grade of recommendation: ✓ What are the clinical risks of maternal obesity to maternal and fetal health in pregnancy? All pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should be provided with accurate and accessible information about the risks associated with obesity in pregnancy and how they may be minimised. Women should be given the opportunity to discuss this information. Grade of recommendation: D What dietetic and exercise advice should be offered in pregnancy? Dietetic advice by an appropriately trained professional should be provided early in the pregnancy where possible in line with NICE Public Health Guideline 27. Grade of recommendation: ✓ What is the role of anti-obesity drugs in pregnancy? Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Grade of recommendation: C What specific risk assessments are required for anaesthetics? Pregnant women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should be referred to an obstetric anaesthetist for consideration of antenatal assessment. Grade of recommendation: D Difficulties with venous access and regional and general anaesthesia should be assessed. In addition, an anaesthetic management plan for labour and birth should be discussed and documented. Multidisciplinary discussion and planning should occur where significant potential difficulties are identified. Grade of recommendation: D What specific risk assessments are required for prevention of pressure sores? Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should have a documented risk assessment in the third trimester of pregnancy by an appropriately qualified professional to consider tissue viability issues. This should involve the use of a validated scale to support clinical judgement. Grade of recommendation: D What special considerations are recommended for screening, diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes in women with obesity? All pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should be screened for gestational diabetes according to NICE or Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guidelines. Grade of recommendation: B What special considerations are recommended for screening, diagnosis and management of hypertensive complications of pregnancy in women with obesity?

,10.1111/wrr.12394,Wound healing society 2015 update on guidelines for venous ulcers,Wound Repair and Regeneration,2015.0,"The Wound Healing Society (WHS) guidelines for the treatment of venous ulcers were originally published in 2006. These guidelines provided recommendations, along with their respective levels of evidence and strength on various categories. Over the past 7 years, a great deal of literature regarding these aspects of venous ulcer management has been published. An advisory panel comprised of academicians, clinicians, and researchers was chosen to update the 2006 guidelines. Members included vascular surgeons, internists, plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, dermatologists, emergency medicine physicians, and registered nurses, all with expertise in wound healing. The goal of this article is to evaluate relevant new findings, on which an updated version of the guidelines will be based. In 2006, in an effort to develop guidelines that could provide clinicians with a reasonable approach to caring for patients, even in the absence of high quality human data, the WHS developed guidelines using a different approach to evidence citations and past approaches to evidence-based guidelines. Most past approaches relied only on publications regarding clinical human studies. Laboratory or animal studies were not cited. We have used well-controlled animal studies that present proof of principle, especially when a clinical series corroborated the laboratory results. Because of this variation, a different system was used to grade the weight of evidence supporting a given guideline. The strength of evidence supporting a guideline is listed as Level I, Level II, or Level III. Since the 2006 guidelines, we sought to capture the highest quality of literature available regarding venous leg ulcer diagnosis and treatment using a key word search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Similarly, the citations of relevant articles were examined by hand. Key terms were generated from the existing guidelines. In this search as opposed to the previous data collection prior to 2006, we used human and disease specific data and limited to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, RCTs, retrospective series reviews, clinical case series, and expert panel recommendations published between January 2006 and present. References prior to 2006 supporting the original guideline recommendations are not included. Therefore, in some cases no additional updated references were included and the support for the guideline recommendation is based on evidence presented in the 2006 guideline. Therefore, no updated references are presented. It was further limited to only English publications. Any relevant additional references found after the formal search were also included. The findings of these articles have been divided into one or more of the appropriate categories as performed in the original guideline. Each of the separate guidelines has undergone a Delphi consensus among the panel members. Not all panel members thought they had sufficient expertise to critique all of the separate sections of the guidelines. The first draft was of the guidelines was presented in 2014 for public comment and subsequent drafts revised based on those comments. Evidence Reference: Preamble: Ulcers of the lower extremity may be caused by a variety of conditions. Elevation of ambulatory venous pressure (venous hypertension) is the most common. However, as treatment of the ulcer may vary depending on ulcer etiology, it is paramount that a correct diagnosis is made before treatment. Guideline #1.1: Gross arterial disease should be ruled out by establishing that pedal pulses are present on physical examination and/or that the ankle: brachial index (ABI) is > 0.8. (Any ABI less than 1.0 suggests a degree of vascular disease and compression therapy is usually considered to be contraindicated with an ABI <0.7.) In elderly patients, patients with diabetes mellitus, or patients with an ABI >1.2, a toe: brachial index of > 0.6 or a trans-cutaneous oxygen partial pressure of >40 mmHg in the region of the ulcer may help to suggest an adequate arterial flow (Level I). Principle: Venous ulcers can exist in the presence of mixed arterial/venous pathology. Treatment of only the elevated venous pressure may not succeed when severe arterial disease is present. However, application of moderate amounts of compression may be successful in healing venous leg ulcers in patients with mild to moderate arterial insufficiency. Updated Evidence: Guideline #1.2: Many criteria have been used to identify a leg ulcer as a “venous” leg ulcer including clinical history and examination, invasive, and noninvasive testing. It is important to understand how the diagnosis was made and to understand the limitations of the method. Color duplex ultrasound scanning including both supine and standing positions to identify abnormal venous reflux and/or obstruction is useful in providing anatomic and physiologic data helping to confirm a venous etiology for the leg ulcer (Level II). Principle: Although clinical history and physical examination can be very suggestive of a venous etiology of the lower extremity ulcer after insufficient arterial inflow has been eliminated, a definitive diagnosis of the venous disease is desirable. This is not always possible. When using various tests to document venous disease, it is paramount that the information needed by the clinician be clearly communicated to the test performer. Updated Evidence: Guideline #1.3: Patients presenting with an apparent venous ulcer and who are suspected of having sickle cell disease should have a sickle cell prep and a hemoglobin electrophoresis (Level II). Principle: Patients with homozygous, heterozygous, or trait sickle cell hemoglobin can present with lower extremity ulcers resembling venous ulcers. Updated Evidence: None. Guideline #1.4: Apparent venous ulcers that have been open continuously without signs of healing for 3 months or that do not demonstrate any response to treatment after 6 weeks should be biopsied for histological diagnosis (Level III). Principle: Malignancy, vasculitis, collagen-vascular diseases, and dermal manifestations of systemic diseases may present as ulcers on the lower extremity. Updated Evidence: None. Guideline #1.5: Apparent venous ulcers, as well as all wounds, that are excessively painful and that progressively increase in size after debridement and/or despite treatment should be considered for other diagnoses such as pyoderma gangrenosum, IgA monoclonal gammopathies, Wegener's granulomatosis, cutaneous chronic granulomatous disease, and mycobacterial or fungal etiologies.

After exclusions, 170 studies were extracted into evidence tables, appraised, and synthesized.Before surgery, patients should shower or bathe (full body) with soap (antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial) or an antiseptic agent on at least the night before the operative day. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered only when indicated based on published clinical practice guidelines and timed such that a bactericidal concentration of the agents is established in the serum and tissues when the incision is made. In cesarean section procedures, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered before skin incision. Skin preparation in the operating room should be performed using an alcohol-based agent unless contraindicated. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, additional prophylactic antimicrobial agent doses should not be administered after the surgical incision is closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. Topical antimicrobial agents should not be applied to the surgical incision. During surgery, glycemic control should be implemented using blood glucose target levels less than 200 mg/dL, and normothermia should be maintained in all patients. Increased fraction of inspired oxygen should be administered during surgery and after extubation in the immediate postoperative period for patients with normal pulmonary function undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Transfusion of blood products should not be withheld from surgical patients as a means to prevent SSI.This guideline is intended to provide new and updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSI and should be incorporated into comprehensive surgical quality improvement programs to improve patient safety.",OpenAlex,0,0,5,6,0,0,False,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,infection,antimicrobial,21.5

Standard-of-care (SOC) therapy alone is often not sufficient to heal these wounds, resulting in application of adjuvant wound therapies including biologic skin substitutes. Although a variety of products exist, it has been difficult to formulate conclusions on their clinical efficacy. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of healing diabetic foot ulcers with biologic skin substitutes.A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Four electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE [Ovid], Cochrane CENTRAL [Ovid], and Web of Science) were searched from inception through February 27, 2019. Searches included keywords and subject headings pertaining to 3 main concepts: biologic skin substitutes, wound healing, and diabetic foot ulcers. Cochrane randomized controlled trial filters were used to narrow results. Data were extracted from 54 included articles, and risk-of-bias assessments were conducted by 2 independent reviewers. The primary objective was to calculate a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 12 weeks. Secondary objectives included a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 6 weeks and mean time to healing.Twenty-five studies were identified that assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 12 weeks. We found that wounds treated with biologic dressings were 1.67 times more likely to heal by 12 weeks than those treated with SOC dressings (P < 0.00001). Five studies assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 6 weeks. Wounds treated with biologic dressings were 2.81 times more likely to heal by 6 weeks than those treated with SOC dressings (P = 0.0001). Descriptively, 29 of 31 studies that assessed time to healing favored biologic dressings over SOC dressings.This systematic review provides supporting evidence that biologic skin substitutes are more effective than SOC dressings at healing diabetic foot ulcers by 12 weeks. Future studies must address the relative benefits of different skin substitutes as well as the long-term implications of these products and their financial considerations.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,9.0

Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Findings: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3·9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1-4·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7·2% (6·0-8·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9% (6·6-9·2) for males and 6·5% (5·4-7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95% UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs 1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). Interpretation: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,4.5

The value of such an approach for providing optimal care has been established, but the definition of evidence-based care and the process used to generate evidence continue to evolve. For example, the role of studies developed to demonstrate efficacy, randomized controlled trials, the value of effectiveness studies designed to evaluate outcomes in real world practice, and the use of disease-oriented (interim) study outcomes for wound care research, such as reduces wound fluid or improves granulation tissue formation, have been topics of international conversations and consensus documents. In addition, the use in some clinical studies and most systematic study reviews of ingredient or characteristic-based categories to group products that may not share a common operational definition of how they function has led to a high variability in outcomes, resulting in inconclusive or low-level evidence. These concerns and debates, along with their influence on practice, may cast doubt on the value of evidence-based practice guidelines for some clinicians, slowing their rate of implementation, and extending the discussion about definitions of evidence-based care and the relative merits of various research designs. At the same time, amid growing concerns about medical device safety, clinicians must answer 3 questions about an intervention and its related products or devices in order to provide safe and effective care: (1) Can it work? (2) Does it work? (3) Is it worth it? Reviewing current knowledge about wound care, wound treatment modalities, and the basic principles of research within the existing framework of questions to be answered suggests a clear path toward obtaining much-needed evidence. In wound care, using clearly defined processes to study patient-centered outcomes (eg, quality of life, complete healing) and only product groupings that meet an operational definition of functioning (eg, moisture-retentive) will help clinicians decide whether an intervention can work and does work and whether the value of the clinical and economic benefits is greater than the potential harm and cost.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,3.0
,10.1001/jama.290.12.1624,Practical Clinical Trials,JAMA,2003.0,"Decision makers in health care are increasingly interested in using high-quality scientific evidence to support clinical and health policy choices; however, the quality of available scientific evidence is often found to be inadequate. Reliable evidence is essential to improve health care quality and to support efficient use of limited resources. The widespread gaps in evidence-based knowledge suggest that systematic flaws exist in the production of scientific evidence, in part because there is no consistent effort to conduct clinical trials designed to meet the needs of decision makers. Clinical trials for which the hypothesis and study design are developed specifically to answer the questions faced by decision makers are called pragmatic or practical clinical trials (PCTs). The characteristic features of PCTs are that they (1) select clinically relevant alternative interventions to compare, (2) include a diverse population of study participants, (3) recruit participants from heterogeneous practice settings, and (4) collect data on a broad range of health outcomes. The supply of PCTs is limited primarily because the major funders of clinical research, the National Institutes of Health and the medical products industry, do not focus on supporting such trials. Increasing the supply of PCTs will depend on the development of a mechanism to establish priorities for these studies, significant expansion of an infrastructure to conduct clinical research within the health care delivery system, more reliance on high-quality evidence by health care decision makers, and a substantial increase in public and private funding for these studies. For these changes to occur, clinical and health policy decision makers will need to become more involved in all aspects of clinical research, including priority setting, infrastructure development, and funding.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,5.0

Design The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. Methods We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management. Results Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose <150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control. Conclusion Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient.

We examined data from the National Center for Health Statistics and reviewed recent literature in order to update the epidemiology of IC. IC-associated mortality has remained stable, at approximately 0.4 deaths per 100,000 population, since 1997, while mortality associated with invasive aspergillosis has continued to decline. Candida albicans remains the predominant cause of IC, accounting for over half of all cases, but Candida glabrata has emerged as the second most common cause of IC in the United States, and several less common Candida species may be emerging, some of which can exhibit resistance to triazoles and/or amphotericin B. Crude and attributable rates of mortality due to IC remain unacceptably high and unchanged for the past 2 decades. Nonpharmacologic preventive strategies should be emphasized, including hand hygiene; appropriate use, placement, and care of central venous catheters; and prudent use of antimicrobial therapy. Given that delays in appropriate antifungal therapy are associated with increased mortality, improved use of early empirical, preemptive, and prophylactic therapies should also help reduce IC-associated mortality. Several studies have now identified important variables that can be used to predict risk of IC and to help guide preventive strategies such as antifungal prophylaxis and early empirical therapy. However, improved non-culture-based diagnostics are needed to expand the potential for preemptive (or early directed) therapy. Further research to improve diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies is necessary to reduce the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with IC.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,antimicrobial,none,1.0

OPTIONS: The following interventions were systematically reviewed for inclusion in the guidelines: enteral nutrition (EN) versus parenteral nutrition (PN), early versus late EN, dose of EN, composition of EN (protein, carbohydrates, lipids, immune‐enhancing additives), strategies to optimize delivery of EN and minimize risks (ie, rate of advancement, checking residuals, use of bedside algorithms, motility agents, small bowel versus gastric feedings, elevation of the head of the bed, closed delivery systems, probiotics, bolus administration), enteral nutrition in combination with supplemental PN, use of PN versus standard care in patients with an intact gastrointestinal tract, dose of PN and composition of PN (protein, carbohydrates, IV lipids, additives, vitamins, trace elements, immune enhancing substances), and the use of intensive insulin therapy. OUTCOMES: The outcomes considered were mortality (intensive care unit [ICU], hospital, and long‐term), length of stay (ICU and hospital), quality of life, and specific complications. EVIDENCE: We systematically searched MEDLINE and CINAHL (cumulative index to nursing and allied health), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials that evaluated any form of nutrition support in critically ill adults. We also searched reference lists and personal files, considering all articles published or unpublished available by August 2002. Each included study was critically appraised in duplicate using a standard scoring system. VALUES: For each intervention, we considered the validity of the randomized trials or meta‐analyses, the effect size and its associated confidence intervals, the homogeneity of trial results, safety, feasibility, and the economic consequences. The context for discussion was mechanically ventilated patients in Canadian ICUs. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: The major potential benefit from implementing these guidelines is improved clinical outcomes of critically ill patients (reduced mortality and ICU stay). Potential harms of implementing these guidelines include increased complications and costs related to the suggested interventions. SUMMARIES OF EVIDENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS: When considering nutrition support in critically ill patients, we strongly recommend that EN be used in preference to PN. We recommend the use of a standard, polymeric enteral formula that is initiated within 24 to 48 hours after admission to ICU, that patients be cared for in the semirecumbent position, and that arginine‐containing enteral products not be used. Strategies to optimize delivery of EN (starting at the target rate, use of a feeding protocol using a higher threshold of gastric residuals volumes, use of motility agents, and use of small bowel feeding) and minimize the risks of EN (elevation of the head of the bed) should be considered. Use of products with fish oils, borage oils, and antioxidants should be considered for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. A glutamine‐enriched formula should be considered for patients with severe burns and trauma. When initiating EN, we strongly recommend that PN not be used in combination with EN. When PN is used, we recommend that it be supplemented with glutamine, where available. Strategies that maximize the benefit and minimize the risks of PN (hypocaloric dose, withholding lipids, and the use of intensive insulin therapy to achieve tight glycemic control) should be considered. There are insufficient data to generate recommendations in the following areas: use of indirect calorimetry; optimal pH of EN; supplementation with trace elements, antioxidants, or fiber; optimal mix of fats and carbohydrates; use of closed feeding systems; continuous versus bolus feedings; use of probiotics; type of lipids; and mode of lipid delivery.

Guidelines for systematic reviews are available and well defined by Cochrane Library (http://www.cochrane.org), but it is important to emphasise that a clearly formulated question is posed and therefore the findings are only truly applicable to that situation. Systematic reviews are challenging as they depend on an exhaustive knowledge of the condition under scrutiny and valid, comparable data designs in the investigations (Holland 2001). It is argued that these prerequisites are not always met, so that some meta-analysis and systematic reviews are of inadequate quality (Holland 2001). The SR is based on inclusion of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to the question posed as this methodology aims to determine cause-and-effect relationships. However, it is worth noting that well-designed case studies, case series and cohort studies often precede RCTs and can provide valuable data for use in study design. They, therefore, are a valuable form of evidence, albeit; lower than the RCT or the SR. The authors of this systematic review have provided the reader with an extensive range of literature pertaining to the use of honey in healthcare. The review was very broad but failed to identify an explicit question. Meta-analysis was not conducted in any of the healthcare areas identified. The authors have raised three key areas that warrant further clarification and the addition of new information in relation to wound care. These include selection of honey for use in wound management, the identification of a further nine RCTs on the use of honey in wound management and finally the limitations inherent in using a quality score to assess reports of RCTs and non-RCTs. These will be commented on here. The typical composition of honey has <20% water and contains enzymes, proteins, vitamins and up to 80% sugars (NHB 2005). Enzymes contained in honey arise from the bee, pollen, nectar and even yeasts (White & Doner 1980). The type of enzymes remains fairly uniform across all honeys; however, variation occurs in the amount of each (NHB 2005). The most significant honey enzymes are invertase, diastase, catalase and glucose oxidase. Glucose oxidase converts glucose to a related material, a gluconalactone, which in turn forms gluconic acid, the principle acid in honey, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (NHB 2005). Catalase, which is found in wound fluid, breaks down the peroxide formed by glucose oxidase to water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide in honey is produced at very low levels, equivalent to about one-thousandth of that in the 3% solution of H2O2, which was widely used as an antiseptic (Bang et al. 2003). It is important to note that both glucose oxidase and H2O2 are heat-sensitive (White & Doner 1980), which is important in terms of storage and method of sterilisation. The colour of honey has seven official categories and varies according to floral source (White & Doner 1980, NHB 2005, Molan 2006) with darker honeys being higher in antioxidants than lighter honey (NHB 2005). Honey also contains 18 free amino acids. The resultant pH of honey is usually in the range of 3·4–6·3 (mean 3·9) (NHB 2005). The antimicrobial activity of honey varies up to 100-fold in efficacy depending on origin and processing method (Allen et al. 1991). Manuka honey in particular, which is derived from the Leptospermum scoparium plant, has demonstrated efficacy against a broad range of wound colonising bacteria, including MRSA, VRE, VSE and Pseudomonas aeurginosa (Cooper et al. 2002a,b, French et al. 2005). Honey thus is not a generic product. The variation in its composition is particularly relevant to selection for use in healthcare and specifically in wound management. Therefore, reports of the efficacy of honey in healthcare should take cognisance of this variation. The systematic review on which this commentary is based identified 33 RCTs involving honey in wound management. An additional nine RCTs involving 934 subjects have been identified, and will be presented here. Two of these were published after the said review was completed, emphasising the rapidity of change within the literature. In the management of burns, three RCTs evaluated the efficacy of topical application of a ‘local’ (Indian) honey on healing outcomes and serum biochemical markers (Subrahmanyam 1993, 2003, Nagane et al. 2004 ). Nagane et al. (2004) demonstrated a more rapid decrease in lipid peroxidation product (LPP) in 60 patients randomised to topical honey vs. silver sulphadiazine (SSD). The honey-treated wounds had faster healing times, and the authors propose that honey is ideally suited for use in burns. Subrahmanyam et al. (2003) also monitored biochemical changes in 60 patients randomised to honey (Indian) or SSD. The rate of reduction in lipid peroxide postburn injury was faster in the honey-treated wounds than control. Healing outcomes were not reported. In the third study, Subrahmanyam (1993) randomised 100 patients with burns and ulcers to topical honey (Indian) vs. SSD. After 10 days, 34 patients in the honey group vs. 10 in the control group had healed. Unfortunately, the results are not stratified according to wound aetiology and treatment allocation, thus limiting interpretation of the findings. These three studies were of poor methodological quality as evidenced by lack of blinding, poor detail on method of randomisation and failure to analyse on an intention to treat basis. In the management of Fournier’s gangrene, Subrahmanyam and Ugane (2004) randomised 30 patients to either honey ‘local’ (India) or Edinburgh University Solution of Lime (EUSOL). Similar to the study by Hejase et al. (1996), the authors reported effective desloughing and odour control in the honey-treated wounds. Healthy granulation tissue was visible after one week in 28·5% of the honey-treated wounds vs. 18·7% in the EUSOL group (Subrahmanyam & Ugane 2004). Further study-specific details are lacking. An RCT of topical ‘Aloe’ honey vs. IntraSite Gel (Smith & Nephew, UK) in 82 shallow wounds and abrasions was conducted to determine the rate and time to healing (Ingle et al. 2006). There were no statistically or clinically significant differences",OpenAlex,0,0,0,3,0,0,True,True,False,False,True,,,,,A,High,,antimicrobial,none,11.0

The Guidelines contain recommendations for the treatment of inguinal hernia from diagnosis till aftercare. They have been developed by a Working Group consisting of expert surgeons with representatives of 14 country members of the EHS. They are evidence-based and, when necessary, a consensus was reached among all members. The Guidelines have been reviewed by a Steering Committee. Before finalisation, feedback from different national hernia societies was obtained. The Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument was used by the Cochrane Association to validate the Guidelines. The Guidelines can be used to adjust local protocols, for training purposes and quality control. They will be revised in 2012 in order to keep them updated. In between revisions, it is the intention of the Working Group to provide every year, during the EHS annual congress, a short update of new high-level evidence (randomised controlled trials [RCTs] and meta-analyses). Developing guidelines leads to questions that remain to be answered by specific research. Therefore, we provide recommendations for further research that can be performed to raise the level of evidence concerning certain aspects of inguinal hernia treatment. In addition, a short summary, specifically for the general practitioner, is given. In order to increase the practical use of the Guidelines by consultants and residents, more details on the most important surgical techniques, local infiltration anaesthesia and a patient information sheet is provided. The most important challenge now will be the implementation of the Guidelines in daily surgical practice. This remains an important task for the EHS. The establishment of an EHS school for teaching inguinal hernia repair surgical techniques, including tips and tricks from experts to overcome the learning curve (especially in endoscopic repair), will be the next step. Working together on this project was a great learning experience, and it was worthwhile and fun. Cultural differences between members were easily overcome by educating each other, respecting different views and always coming back to the principles of evidence-based medicine. The members of the Working Group would like to thank the EHS board for their support and especially Ethicon for sponsoring the many meetings that were needed to finalise such an ambitious project.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,8.0

,10.1111/j.1742-481x.2009.00620_1.x,Letter: Evidence‐Based Wound Care in the UK: A Response to David Leaper's Editorial in <i>International Wound Journal</i> April 2009 6 (2),International Wound Journal,2009.0,"In David Leaper's editorial published in April 2009 1, some important points are made. These include the necessity for evidence-based practice and standards, the limited evidence for some wound care management strategies, and the difficulty this poses for making recommendations for clinical practice. However, other points made about the usefulness of observational evidence for the evaluation of interventions and that in the field of wound care 'further Cochrane systematic reviews are not likely to achieve much' (p. 90) are debatable 1. Professor Leaper confuses the primary functions of Cochrane reviews and clinical guidelines, the former being to address the question of the effectiveness of particular interventions and the latter being to provide recommendations to guide clinical practice. He criticises Cochrane reviews for failing to admit all the available (experimental and observational) evidence, unlike guidelines, and then producing recommendations that further research is needed, while failing to provide clinical guidance. Professor Leaper also argues that Cochrane reviews do not benefit from the input of an expert panel and that review authors have scientific skills with no topic-related knowledge. The Cochrane Collaboration is an organisation in large part driven by the efforts of those carrying out systematic reviews on a voluntary (unpaid) basis. Many of these volunteer review authors are clinicians who are very keen to further the evidence base in topic areas where they have a high level of knowledge, experience and expertise. In reviews of wound management, these people include physicians, surgeons, nurses and podiatrists. In addition, each Cochrane review is subject to a very rigorous peer review process by both clinical and methodological experts, and so overall there is ample opportunity for clinical input, helping to ensure that Cochrane reviews are methodologically sound but also relevant in terms of topic coverage and interpretation of findings. In commenting on a systematic review on antibiotics and antiseptics used with venous leg ulcers, Professor Leaper describes 'the lack of expertise on the panel'. We are pleased to confirm that this review team represented a wealth of clinical knowledge and experience including medicine, nursing, pharmacology and clinical research 2. Cochrane reviews in the field of wound care (and other areas) are important because in addition to summarising the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for the benefit of patients, health care practitioners and policy-makers, they highlight gaps in the evidence, make recommendations for further research to address these gaps and identify design flaws in published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) so that future researchers can address methodological weaknesses by improving trial design and conduct. Unfortunately, it is often the case that published trials may have methodological inadequacies. There is therefore room for methodological improvement but the answer does not lie in using observational research designs to evaluate effectiveness. That the Cochrane Collaboration has highlighted that many wound care treatments have been inadequately evaluated using inappropriate designs, poorly conducted trials and small samples should spur wound care researchers to address these issues. An 'unhelpful systematic review' (p. 90) of topical negative pressure therapy (TNP) is used to illustrate the point in Professor Leaper's editorial that alerting clinicians of the shortcomings and weaknesses in this evidence in a recent Cochrane review may be 'unacceptable' to practitioners, particularly as '…many experienced practitioners… are aware that TNP has saved lives and limbs' (p. 90) 1. However, the dangers of relying on clinical experience alone have been well documented and includes 'bad' decisions that are not in the best interests of the patient 3. Leaper then presents an argument for considering lower levels of evidence and 'time-honoured practice' to guide clinical practice. However, it is unclear why aiming for rigorous evaluations of wound care treatments should pose any greater difficulties than for other healthcare treatments and why we would want to disadvantage patients by relying on inferior evidence to make decisions about optimal care. In the absence of well-conducted research, it is also worth asking how practitioners know that TNP, for example, has resulted in positive outcomes and whether the perceived positive effects are not because of some other factor. Related to this, it is useful to highlight how some 'time-honoured practices' that are assumed to be the best for the patient may not be. It is only when RCTs (or systematic reviews of RCTs) are conducted that this becomes evident. For example, use of compression stockings in the surgical setting is known to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, a recent trial 4 has shown that the assumption (as made in clinical guidelines on the topic) that graduated compression stockings would also be beneficial for other patient populations with reduced mobility (in this case patients unable to walk following stroke) was inaccurate. In fact, the large RCT showed that there was no difference in the incidence of DVT between the group with no stockings and those with stockings. The only significant differences between the groups was the greater numbers of skin problems (skin ulcers, blisters and irritation) in the group that were wearing stockings. Clearly, 'obvious' assumptions can be false. Given that the primary purpose of a Cochrane review is to summarise the evidence for questions of cause and effect, reviewers are correct in being cautious about providing definitive conclusions from less than reliable evidence. Admission of observational evidence would precipitate even more caution in Cochrane reviews as health care research is littered with examples where observational evidence can seriously mislead practitioners and the public. Some of these examples include diethylstilbestrol for recurrent miscarriage, class 1 c anti-arrhythmics for preventing death post-myocardial infarction, beta-carotene for preventing lung cancer in smokers and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for preventing cardiovascular disease in women. It is disingenuous to argue that the case has been settled, as Professor Leaper does, that there is little difference in treatment estimates from well-designed observational research and trials–the methodological research that argues such a position benefits from hindsight and is not widely accepted. There is plenty of evidence that non randomised studies exaggerate treatment effects 5-7.

,10.4103/2229-5178.137820,"Venous leg ulcer: Topical treatment, dressings and surgical debridement",Indian Dermatology Online Journal,2014.0,"INTRODUCTION Wounds and skin are colonized by bacteria and currently there is a lack of evidence that the presence of colonizing bacteria impedes wound healing. In a systematic review of antimicrobials, including antiseptics on chronic wounds[1] In another systematic review that looked for effects of using tap water in comparison to distilled water or boiled water or normal saline for cleansing of wound found no difference in infection or healing rates, while using any of them.[2] DEBRIDEMENT Necrotic tissue left in the ulcer contributes to reduced host resistance to infections because it acts like a foreign body. In this area, there is usually a high concentration of harmful proteases and bacteria that can inhibit wound healing. Skin debridement consists of removing nonviable, nonbleeding slough. A chronic wound has to be converted bydebridement to an acute wound and hence that itcan proceed through the normal healing phases. Removal of necrotic and devitalized tissue can be achieved through mechanical, autolytic, or enzymatic, and biological debridement.[3] SURGICAL DEBRIDEMENT It is carried out using a curette and scissors where chronic wound is converted into an acute wound. Neutrophils and macrophages, which are recruited to the area secrete growth factors and phagocytize the bacteria and nonviable tissue. Mechanical debridement should be undertaken by the expert with the surgical skills (evidence level C).[4] AUTOLYTIC DEBRIDEMENT This is the gentle separation of slough from the wound bed that occurs slowly in a moist wound environment. It is accomplished by placing an occlusive dressing on a wound and allowing proteases within the wound space to liquefy the necrotic tissue and useful in patients with bleeding tendencies where surgical debridement is not feasible. ENZYMATIC DEBRIDEMENT Consists of application of topical protease preparation that targets the fibrin and collagen of necrotic tissue. These include papain urea preparations; Papain obtained from papaya contains protease and urea are a protein denaturant. Collagenase derived from Clostridium histolyticum. BIODEBRIDEMENT This is achieved by using maggots. They are the larvae of a species of fly (Lucilia sericata) also known as ""green bottle"" blow fly, which selectively debride the dead tissue and tissue debris by secreting collagenase and mixture of other enzymes. TOPICAL ANTIMICROBIALS AND ANTISEPTICS In chronic wounds, reduction of certain microbial species, such as anaerobic bacteria in order to limit undesirable odors or perhaps mixed communities of four or more bacterial species that impede healing, use of topical antibiotics may be justified (evidence level C).[5] Various studies on dressings incorporating antibiotics and antiseptics are reviewed, but no single consensus for any particular topical agent could be made. This is partly due to the different mechanism and spectrum of action of the antimicrobials. The most frequently used topical antimicrobials in wound care practice are chlorhexidine, iodine, silver containing products, mupriocin and fucidic acid. In the past, acetic acid, honey, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, potassium permanganate, and proflavine have been used. CHLORHEXIDINE IMPREGNATED DRESSINGS In a recent review of human studies has demonstrated that it is associated with few adverse effects on healing.[6] Despite reports of decreased bacterial counts, increased healing rates, and lack of toxicity, it is concluded that at present, there is insufficient data to assess safety and efficacy, and that further clinical trials are required before the use of chlorhexidine on open wounds is either recommended or condemned. Iodine It is available as povidone-iodine and second generation dextranomer and cadexomer. In one study, healing rates of chronic venous leg ulcers, each treated with one of three topical agents (silver sulfadiazine and chlorhexidine digluconate) were compared to untreated control ulcers in each respective patient. All agents were seen to reduce bacterial load resulting in slight improvements in healing rates and times, but povidone-iodine yielded statistically significant better outcome. Furthermore, histological assessment indicated a lack of cytotoxicity because povidone-iodine induced less change in microvessels and dendrocytes.[7] In addition, a report of the ability of iodine released from a dressing to modulate the secretion of cytokines by human macrophages in vitro has provided another justification of its role in promoting healing.[8] It reduces bacterial load, decreases infection rates and promotes healing (evidence level C).[78] Cadexomer iodine It leads to reduction of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with evidence from clinical reports of efficacy in stimulating healing (evidence level C).[9] Its lack of toxicity for human fibroblasts in vitro suggests low potential of toxicity for chronic wounds in vivo (evidence level D).[10] Silver sulfadiazine At present, human studies with silver containing dressings are rather limited, yet many trials provide encouraging results.[11] In an uncontrolled, prospective study of a series of chronic wounds treated with an ionized nanocrystalline silver dressing demonstrated improved clinical parameters together with decreased surface wound bioburden, but unchanged deep tissue loads. The implication was that surface flora contributed more significantly to delayed healing than deeper flora (evidence level D).[12] MUPIROCIN A systematic review identified one small randomized controlled trials (RCT) (n = 30) of patients with leg ulcer, which compared topical mupirocin with placebo, in addition to standard compression for all. There was no significant difference between groups in rates of complete healing, or eradication of Gram-positive bacteria.[13] There is insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation for mupirocin. RETAPAMULIN Retapamulin, in the class of pleuromutilin antibiotics acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by interacting at a site on the 50S ribosome subunit of bacterial ribosome. In 664 isolates of S. aureus, including many with high levels of resistance to mupirocin and fusidic acid and 448 (73%) MRSA isolates, retapamulin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity.[14] More clinical studies of retapamulin in the treatment of resistant S. aureus are needed. Dressings A moist environment to accelerate wound healing is very important to accelerate wound healing. This can be accomplished by frequent application of saline dressings over the wound, which helps to keep the wound surface moist, debrides the wound and removes the surface bacteria. Recent research on wound care has resulted in increased use of interactive and active dressings rather than passive dressings that cover and absorb. Active dressings stimulate growth factors,",OpenAlex,0,1,3,6,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,antimicrobial,infection,20.0

QUESTION 1: DOES IMPROVING GLYCEMIC CONTROL IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR INPATIENTS WITHHYPERGLYCEMIA? -Hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients, irrespective of its cause, is unequivocally associated with adverse outcomes (5,6,18 -25).Hyperglycemia occurs in patients with known or undiagnosed diabetes, or it occurs during acute illness in those with previously normal glucose tolerance (termed ""stress hyperglycemia"") (8,26).Intervention directed at reducing blood glucose (BG) levels has resulted in improved outcomes in some, but not all, studies (5,18 -25).Several recent clinical trials in critically ill patients have reported no reduction in mortality from intensive treatment targeting near-euglycemia versus conventional management targeting BG Ͻ180 mg/dl (Ͻ10.0 mmol/l).Of considerable concern are reports of harm, with higher rates of severe hypoglycemia and even increased mortality (14) resulting from intensive glycemic control (12)(13)(14)16,27,28).This variability in results may be attributable to several factors, including differences in intravenous (IV) insulin treatment protocols and their implementation, glycemic targets, patient populations, methods for glucose monitoring, and insulin adjustment (12,29).The following section focuses primarily on results of recent studies with an RCT design that investigated patient outcomes with protocols targeting nearnormalization of BG levels.Readers are referred to a previous ACE position statement (9), an ACE/ADA consensus statement (11), and a technical review (8) for details related to earlier studies supporting inpatient glycemic management.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,3.0

Geriatric syndromes, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty, are highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes. Nevertheless, this central geriatric concept has remained poorly defined. This article reviews criteria for defining geriatric syndromes and proposes a balanced approach of developing preliminary criteria based on peer‐reviewed evidence. Based on a review of the literature, four shared risk factors—older age, baseline cognitive impairment, baseline functional impairment, and impaired mobility—were identified across five common geriatric syndromes (pressure ulcers, incontinence, falls, functional decline, and delirium). Understanding basic mechanisms involved in geriatric syndromes will be critical to advancing research and developing targeted therapeutic options, although given the complexity of these multifactorial conditions, attempts to define relevant mechanisms will need to incorporate more‐complex models, including a focus on synergistic interactions between different risk factors. Finally, major barriers have been identified in translating research advances, such as preventive strategies of proven effectiveness for delirium and falls, into clinical practice and policy initiatives. National strategic initiatives are required to overcome barriers and to achieve clinical, research, and policy advances that will improve quality of life for older persons.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

Although frailty is not confined to elderly persons, it is more frequently observed in persons older than 85 years of age (the ""oldest old"") (1). This is because limitations and diseases associated with aging are an inseparable part of frailty (2-5). As a result, frailty remains more a constellation of many conditions than a discrete clinical entity, and it certainly does not have a precise scientific meaning (6).

In particular, the medically most important Klebsiella species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, accounts for a significant proportion of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections, pneumonia, septicemias, and soft tissue infections. The principal pathogenic reservoirs for transmission of Klebsiella are the gastrointestinal tract and the hands of hospital personnel. Because of their ability to spread rapidly in the hospital environment, these bacteria tend to cause nosocomial outbreaks. Hospital outbreaks of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella spp., especially those in neonatal wards, are often caused by new types of strains, the so-called extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. The incidence of ESBL-producing strains among clinical Klebsiella isolates has been steadily increasing over the past years. The resulting limitations on the therapeutic options demand new measures for the management of Klebsiella hospital infections. While the different typing methods are useful epidemiological tools for infection control, recent findings about Klebsiella virulence factors have provided new insights into the pathogenic strategies of these bacteria. Klebsiella pathogenicity factors such as capsules or lipopolysaccharides are presently considered to be promising candidates for vaccination efforts that may serve as immunological infection control measures.",OpenAlex,0,0,2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,infection,none,3.0

Mortality rates associated with the development of a DFU are estimated to be 5% in the first 12 months, and 5‐year morality rates have been estimated at 42%. The standard practices in DFU management include surgical debridement, dressings to facilitate a moist wound environment and exudate control, wound off‐loading, vascular assessment, and infection and glycemic control. These practices are best coordinated by a multidisciplinary diabetic foot wound clinic. Even with this comprehensive approach, there is still room for improvement in DFU outcomes. Several adjuvant therapies have been studied to reduce DFU healing times and amputation rates. We reviewed the rationale and guidelines for current standard of care practices and reviewed the evidence for the efficacy of adjuvant agents. The adjuvant therapies reviewed include the following categories: nonsurgical debridement agents, dressings and topical agents, oxygen therapies, negative pressure wound therapy, acellular bioproducts, human growth factors, energy‐based therapies, and systemic therapies. Many of these agents have been found to be beneficial in improving wound healing rates, although a large proportion of the data are small, randomized controlled trials with high risks of bias.",OpenAlex,0,0,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,none,5.5

The recommendation was that units should see in excess of 95% of referrals within 2 weeks. This recommendation has successfully improved service delivery and patient processing within the NHS, although evidence of improved outcomes is unproven (Hitchins et al., 2014; Patel et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2013). In 2005, the NHS National Cancer Plan produced treatment targets for colorectal cancer, consisting of 62 days from ‘2 week’ referral and 31 days from the ‘decision to treat date’ (Department of Health, 2006). However, the health service's primary emphasis should be on quality and outcomes, rather than on time to treatment (Murchie et al., 2014). Treatment should begin within 31 days of the decision to treat. Recommendation grade D A colorectal cancer MDT serving a population of 200 000 is expected to manage around 120 new patients per year. Quality cancer treatment depends on coordination between multiple treatments and treatment providers, the exchange of technical information, and effective communication between clinical, nursing and other disciplines involved in the patients’ management. Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) should improve coordination, communication, and decision making between health-care team members and patients, and produce better outcomes. This can be achieved by reflective practice, audit, patient surveys, MDT ‘away days’ to develop the service delivered. Feedback should be systematically evaluated and any changes made to the care for both the general patient population and for individual patients, should be subsequently reviewed and evaluated by the team to see if improvement has been achieved. Despite the standardization of delivery of cancer services via this method, research showing the effectiveness of MDT working is scarce (Fennell et al., 2014; Fleissig et al., 2006). The ACPGBI ‘Resources for Coloproctology 2015’ document (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, 2015) informs clinicians, managers, medical directors, chief executives and politicians, to address any existing inequalities in care for patients and achieve uniform standards nationally. The core colorectal MDT should include; The extended MDT members should include; The management plans for all colorectal cancer patients should be reviewed by a Colorectal MDT. Recommendation grade C There have been a number of reports assessing effects of surgical specialization and patient throughput (both the number of cases treated per surgeon and per hospital) on outcomes in colorectal cancer (Etzioni et al., 2014). The NICE colorectal cancer guidance (2004) identified 6 systematic reviews and 28 other studies in this field. The evidence indicates that better surgical specialization and training is associated with improved outcomes, particularly in rectal cancer (Archampong et al., 2012; Etzioni et al., 2014). These benefits of surgical specialization appear more pronounced for rectal cancer than for colon cancer. In rectal cancer, 11 of 13 studies reported that more specialized surgeons achieved better outcomes. Six out of eight good quality studies showed significant effects on one or more of the following measures; survival rates (up to 5 years), quality of surgery (assessed by complication rates or tumour-free excision margins) and local recurrence rates (Archampong et al., 2012). Greater specialization is also associated with shorter in-patient stay and less frequent use of stomas (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2004). It is advised that each surgeon in the MDT should ideally carry out a minimum of 20 radical colorectal cancer resections per annum (The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, 2012). Surgery for colorectal cancer should be performed by surgeons with appropriate training and experience, working within an MDT. Recommendation grade B The 2000 NHS Cancer Plan (Department of Health, 2000) initially highlighted the important role of the CNS within the pathway for cancer patients. The initial paper stressed that CNSs were needed to provide psychological support but subsequent papers acknowledge the wider contribution to the overall quality and effectiveness of patients’ cancer management (Department of Health, 2011a). National cancer patient surveys demonstrate that by having access to a CNS, patients’ cancer experiences are much better co-ordinated, leading to better outcomes (Quality Health.). The colorectal CNS works autonomously and uses their training and experience of colorectal cancer to assist patients with their concerns and problems, whilst they are undergoing assessment, diagnosis, treatment and follow up of their disease. The CNS is seen as the key worker or patient advocate and is the person within the MDT who is most accessible to patients, working closely with them and their families/carers to provide information and constant support at each stage of their care (National Cancer Action Team, 2010). Their role is pivotal to coordinate access to different services and clinicians during individual patients’ clinical journey. As well as being a clinical expert within colorectal cancer, the CNS should possess a first level degree and have completed or is working towards, post-registration learning, specific to their specialism and role, such as advanced communication skills, leadership, management, teaching and research (Macmillan, 2015). The CNS will have a role in transforming patients’ experiences of cancer care by CNS-led activities such as improving quality and experience of care, reinforcing safety, increasing efficiency and demonstrating management and leadership (National Cancer Action Team, 2010). The intention of treatment, whether curative, potentially curative or palliative should be discussed in the MDT and communicated to the patient and primary care team. However, surgery for colorectal cancer should be avoided if the risks are deemed to outweigh the potential benefits, such as when the patient has major co-morbidity or the tumour is deemed unresectable. In this situation, a further opinion from another surgeon, or surgeons, or other relevant professionals, is encouraged if there are ongoing concerns about this decision in the mind of the surgeon, the patient, relatives or carers. There is increasing need to consider colorectal cancer surgery in older and high-risk patients, who often have multiple and significant co-morbidities. Good preoperative preparation will reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.

However, microbiota dysbiosis can lead to dysregulation of bodily functions and diseases including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, respiratory diseases, etc. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of how microbiota links to host health or pathogenesis. We first summarize the research of microbiota in healthy conditions, including the gut-brain axis, colonization resistance and immune modulation. Then, we highlight the pathogenesis of microbiota dysbiosis in disease development and progression, primarily associated with dysregulation of community composition, modulation of host immune response, and induction of chronic inflammation.

Postoperative pain is not adequately managed in greater than 80% of patients in the US, although rates vary depending on such factors as type of surgery performed, analgesic/anesthetic intervention used, and time elapsed after surgery. Poorly controlled acute postoperative pain is associated with increased morbidity, functional and quality-of-life impairment, delayed recovery time, prolonged duration of opioid use, and higher health-care costs. In addition, the presence and intensity of acute pain during or after surgery is predictive of the development of chronic pain. More effective analgesic/anesthetic measures in the perioperative period are needed to prevent the progression to persistent pain. Although clinical findings are inconsistent, some studies of local anesthetics and nonopioid analgesics have suggested potential benefits as preventive interventions. Conventional opioids remain the standard of care for the management of acute postoperative pain; however, the risk of opioid-related adverse events can limit optimal dosing for analgesia, leading to poorly controlled acute postoperative pain. Several new opioids have been developed that modulate µ-receptor activity by selectively engaging intracellular pathways associated with analgesia and not those associated with adverse events, creating a wider therapeutic window than unselective conventional opioids.

One discerned the cause of a given condition and then applied a treatment that would be expected to correct the underlying disease process. As long as the cause, pathophysiology, and therapeutic mechanism all made sense, it was not thought necessary to look too hard at how well anything worked. This internally consistent approach to health care gave us purgatives, bleeding, mutilative surgeries, and a host of herbal and pharmaceutical treatments that fit perfectly with prevailing views of disease etiology. However, most therapies were ineffective, caused serious side effects, or both. The emergence of modern medicine from its dark ages began in earnest in the middle of the 20th century, when we began to subject treatments to randomized, controlled trials to find out whether they actually did any good. A large proportion did not (1). In 1962, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was first given authority to require the radical criterion of trial-documented efficacy before a drug could be granted marketing approval (2).Armed with this powerful intellectual tool, medicine has made impressive headway in the past 50 years in separating the therapeutic wheat from the chaff of quackery. Countless lives were saved because we got better at distinguishing treatments that worked from those that did not or that harmed patients (3). New laws and policies backed the scientific superiority of the randomized, controlled trial with regulatory clout that made it the law of the land, at least for drug approval. Yet other factors weighed against this movement. First, physicians crave autonomy, as evidenced by the sometimes slow uptake of recommendations from those trials about what we should and should not do (4). Second, pharmaceutical manufacturers found that substantial profits could be made by selling their products to a population much larger than the limited group of patients for whom high-quality and FDA-reviewed efficacy data actually exist. Off-label marketing campaigns flourished in the 1990s and early 2000s, with several companies promoting drugs for uses for which there was neither FDA approval nor credible evidence of efficacy (5).Of course, a drug may have reasonable evidence supporting its use in particular clinical situations even if the FDA has not defined these as approved indications, perhaps because a manufacturer has not formally applied for that designation. For example, propranolol was initially approved for tachyarrhythmias, and its use as an antihypertensive and antianginal agent was at first “off-label.” At present, rosuvastatin (Crestor, AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Delaware) is the only statin that is approved by the FDA for some patients with high C-reactive protein and normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, although many researchers in this area believe that other statins may have similar efficacy for this purpose. Thus, off-label prescribing can run the gamut from adequately data-driven to truly implausible and potentially harmful. The latter case is illustrated by gabapentin (Neurontin, Pfizer, New York, New York), whose manufacturer agreed in 2004 to pay the government $430 million to settle charges of improper off-label marketing. Its promotional campaigns had been so successful that by 2004, an estimated 90% of Neurontin sales were for off-label uses (6), including many indications with little convincing evidence of efficacy. A recent review of off-label prescribing among office-based physicians found that a sobering 73% of off-label prescribing had little or no scientific support (7).This brings us to the case of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) (NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark), the recombinant procoagulant originally approved in 1999 solely for the management of patients with hemophilia, especially those who had developed inhibitors to factor VIII. However, not many persons have hemophilia and even fewer have inhibitors to factor VIII; in fact, there is so little hemophilia in the marketplace that rFVIIa was approved as an orphan drug under a legislative program designed to incentivize drug development for patients with rare diseases. That law provides manufacturers with numerous financial benefits, including tax breaks for research and 7 years of guaranteed market exclusivity after approval.However, in this issue, Logan and colleagues (8) show that use of rFVIIa in hospitalized patients without hemophilia grew more than 140-fold from 2000 to 2008 (8). By the end of that period, its approved indication for hemophilia comprised only 3% of its in-hospital use, with 97% of its use for off-label indications, including cardiovascular surgery, trauma, intracerebral hemorrhage, and other purposes. One explanation may derive from the understandable desire of surgeons and neurologists to protect their patients from excessive bleeding, and such use has the Galenic justification of appearing logical on its face: “The patient is bleeding! Administer a procoagulant!”It is not yet clear whether improper promotion of the product contributed to this rapid expansion of use. The manufacturer has denied such practices (9), although it is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Defense (10), which was reported to be looking into “financial arrangements between the [army] and Novo Nordisk” related to use of NovoSeven in overseas combat operations (11). There is reason to wonder how the use of an obscure recombinant coagulation factor marketed exclusively to hematologists came to be used so widely by cardiac surgeons, neurologists, and trauma specialists. Further investigation may cast additional light on this question (12).Is such off-label use nonetheless warranted by solid trial evidence? Yank and coworkers (13) address this topic in this issue. In this study, investigators systematically reviewed the literature on the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa used for a variety of unapproved indications. They identified all available reports that addressed this issue and found 64 worthy of review. Only 16 were randomized, controlled trials; the others were observational studies (n = 26) that",OpenAlex,0,6,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,True,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,none,12.0

Much of the published research on pressure ulcers has been underpowered and has focused on early signs of healing rather than more definitive outcomes. As a result, the 2014 international clinical practice guideline on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment includes only 77 statements with evidence to support them, whereas the remaining 498 statements are based on expert opinion (1). This issue includes clinical practice guidelines developed by the American College of Physicians (ACP) on the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers (2, 3). These guidelines are based on systematic reviews prepared by an Evidence-based Practice Center funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that evaluated evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to prevent and treat pressure ulcers (4, 5). Unlike the international guideline, the ACP guidelines contain only recommendations supported by evidence. This raises issues about the helpfulness of the recommendations at the bedside, where treatment decisions must sometimes be made in the absence of good evidence.The ACP guidance reflects that risk assessment tools for pressure ulcers are imperfect predictors of risk. Pressure ulcers typically develop in patients with limited ability to participate in their own care. Therefore, application of the principles that are used to predict risk for other conditions, such as cancer, is problematic. First, patients with pressure ulcers often cannot participate in decisions about whether to have risk assessment. Second, the low sensitivity and specificity of pressure ulcer risk assessment are expected because risk can change within minutes (for example, from anesthesia or sedation). These varying risks are not captured unless the risk assessment tool is completed contemporaneously with changes in patient condition. Further, tools to assess pressure ulcer risk are often used in populations that differ from those in which they were developed. The Braden Scale, the most commonly used tool in the United States, was initially developed for long-term care residents. When applied in acute care settings, it was found to predict pressure ulcers poorly for surgical patients or those with highly acute illness (6). A recent meta-analysis showed 3 variables that predict pressure ulcers in all patients: immobility, perfusion, and prior skin injury (7). At the bedside, other risk factors, such as age and race, become part of the clinical judgment used to predict risk. When used appropriately, the Braden Scale can be a useful screening tool, but clinical judgment should also be used to guide decisions about care.That the ACP did not consider levels of risk in the recommendations on support surfaces is disappointing. The older studies cited by the ACP compared foam mattresses with a “standard hospital bed,” which was seldom described and may have included spring mattresses. Therefore, static foam mattresses seemed to be better surfaces—but better than what? Evidence supports the use of reactive surfaces, such as foam mattresses, for prevention in low-risk patients who can be moved from side to side (1). The ACP does not recommend more expensive support surfaces for prevention, and although this is generally reasonable, the expert opinion from the international guideline recommended that very-high-risk patients who cannot be moved be placed on active support surfaces, such as alternating-air or low–air-loss surfaces (1). Although advanced support surfaces are more costly than foam surfaces, the cost–benefit ratio may favor their use in selected high-risk patients.The ACP guideline panel also found insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for oral nutritional supplementation as a means of pressure ulcer prevention. Yet, a 2005 meta-analysis concluded that oral supplementation with 400 to 500 calories daily for 4 to 72 weeks was associated with a 25% reduction in pressure ulcer rates (8).Because pressure ulcers are largely preventable, pressure ulcer prevention programs have become a safety initiative for many health care systems. The ACP guideline notes that risk assessment is often part of these bundled care practices and that multicomponent interventions can improve patient outcomes. The success of these programs in reducing pressure ulcer incidence is believed to be attributable to their engagement of leadership and administration, involvement of direct care providers, continuous education of staff, and sustained audits and feedback (9).Although pressure ulcer prevention focuses on reduction of pressure on body sites of at-risk patients, pressure ulcer management is based on 3 principles: removing the offending agent (pressure), protecting the wound from contamination, and promoting healing through nutrition. It is useful to review how the new ACP guideline reflects these principles and why the evidence that the ACP would require to make more definitive recommendations is lacking.The ACP guideline states that there is weak evidence for the effect of various support surfaces on pressure ulcer healing. Restrictions in payment for advanced support surfaces have contributed to the scarcity of observational data on their effectiveness. Generally, a patient qualifies for reimbursement for the use of an advanced support surface when a stage 3 or 4 pressure ulcer is present but no longer qualifies once the ulcer shows signs of healing and is downstaged to stage 2. Although evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of these surfaces, the international guideline provides expert opinion on the appropriate type of support surface for patients with pressure ulcers until better evidence is available. Regardless of the surface used, it is imperative that the patient continue to be turned to relieve pressure on the ulcer. High-quality research is needed to determine which surfaces promote complete and durable closure of pressure ulcers.The ACP recommendations also highlight the scarcity of definitive data on other interventions to promote wound healing. The guideline statements on hydrocolloid and foam dressings stem from weak, low-quality evidence. Because chronic wounds are contaminated and biofilms exist in them, antiseptic dressings, such as those containing silver, honey, and cadexomer iodine, seem to be justified.

,,Skin Substitutes for Treating Chronic Wounds [Internet],,2012.0,"Background Normal healthy skin provides a protective barrier against microbes, water loss, and ultraviolet light damage; helps with thermoregulation; and provides tactile sensations. Wounds are disruptions of the skin’s structural and functional integrity and normally transition through distinct phases of healing until the skin’s structure and function are restored. Chronic wounds have failed to pass through the normal healing process. Patients with chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers, experience loss of function, pain, wound recurrence, and significant morbidity. Care for chronic wounds involves removing necrotic tissue, applying dressings that maintain a moist wound environment, treating wound infections, and restoring blood flow to the wound site. If these procedures fail to restore the healing process, additional therapies may be considered. Purpose This Technical Brief describes the various products commercially available in the United States that may be considered skin substitutes, examines systems used to classify skin substitutes, identifies and assesses the clinical literature evaluating skin substitutes published since the 2012 AHRQ report Skin Substitutes for Treating Chronic Wounds, and suggests the best practices that may be part of any future studies evaluating skin substitutes. Methods We performed a systematic search of the published literature (EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL) and grey literature since 2012. We received scientific packets from manufacturers during AHRQ’s call for Supplemental Evidence and Data for Systematic Reviews (SEADS) from March 25 to April 29, 2019. We searched for systematic reviews/meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective nonrandomized comparative studies examining commercially available skin substitutes in individuals with diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and arterial leg ulcers. We extracted data on clinical outcomes, such as complete wound healing, healing rate, and recurrence. We compared study eligibility criteria and outcomes measured between included studies and ongoing clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov to identify trends in the field. We interviewed Key Informants with expertise in chronic wound care to help identify classification systems to categorize the skin substitutes, guide study eligibility criteria, describe limitations in the current field, and recommend best practices for designing future studies. Findings We identified 76 commercially available skin substitutes and categorized them based on the Davison-Kotler classification system. Sixty-eight (89%) were categorized as acellular dermal substitutes, mostly replacements from human placental membranes and animal tissue sources. Three systematic reviews and 22 RCTs examined use of 16 distinct skin substitutes, including acellular dermal substitutes, cellular dermal substitutes, and cellular epidermal and dermal substitutes in diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous leg ulcers. Twenty-one ongoing clinical trials (all RCTs) examined an additional nine skin substitutes with similar classifications. Studies rarely reported clinical outcomes, such as amputation, wound recurrence at least 2 weeks after treatment ended, or patient-related outcomes, such as return to function, pain, exudate, and odor. The lack of studies examining the efficacy of most skin substitute products and the need for better-designed and -reported studies providing more clinically relevant data in this field are this Technical Brief’s clearest implications.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,False,,,,,A,High,,general,none,8.0

Here we report the factors determining insulin requirements and the impact of insulin dose vs. blood glucose control on the observed outcome benefits.A prospective, randomized, controlled trial.A 56-bed predominantly surgical intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching hospital.A total of 1,548 patients were randomly assigned to either strict normalization of blood glucose (80-110 mg/dL) with insulin infusion or the conventional approach, in which insulin is only given to maintain blood glucose levels at 180-200 mg/dL.It was feasible and safe to achieve and maintain blood glucose levels at <110 mg/dL by using a titration algorithm. Stepwise linear regression analysis identified body mass index, history of diabetes, reason for intensive care unit admission, at-admission hyperglycemia, caloric intake, and time in intensive care unit as independent determinants of insulin requirements, together explaining 36% of its variation. With nutritional intake increasing from a mean of 550 to 1600 calories/day during the first 7 days of intensive care, normoglycemia was reached within 24 hrs, with a mean daily insulin dose of 77 IU and maintained with 94 IU on day 7. Insulin requirements were highest and most variable during the first 6 hrs of intensive care (mean, 7 IU/hr; 10% of patients required >20 IU/hr). Between day 7 and 12, insulin requirements decreased by 40% on stable caloric intake. Brief, clinically harmless hypoglycemia occurred in 5.2% of intensive insulin-treated patients on median day 6 (2-14) vs. 0.8% of conventionally treated patients on day 11 (2-10). The outcome benefits of intensive insulin therapy were equally present regardless of whether patients received enteral feeding. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the lowered blood glucose level rather than the insulin dose was related to reduced mortality (p <.0001), critical illness polyneuropathy (p <.0001), bacteremia (p =.02), and inflammation (p =.0006) but not to prevention of acute renal failure, for which the insulin dose was an independent determinant (p =.03). As compared with normoglycemia, an intermediate blood glucose level (110-150 mg/dL) was associated with worse outcome.Normoglycemia was safely reached within 24 hrs and maintained during intensive care by using insulin titration guidelines. Metabolic control, as reflected by normoglycemia, rather than the infused insulin dose, was related to the beneficial effects of intensive insulin therapy.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,general,none,3.0

Recent Advances: A meta-analysis was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched using the following keywords: diabetes mellitus AND skin graft OR tissue replacement OR dressing OR drug. Two independent reviewers performed data collection and quality assessment of the eligible studies. The primary outcome was the 12- to 16-week healing rates and the secondary outcome was recurrence rates. Critical Issues: Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials, including 3,862 patients, were analyzed. The studies exhibited low heterogeneity (τ2 = 0.10) without significant asymmetry (Egger's test, p = 0.8852). After pooling direct and indirect estimates, placenta-based tissue products exhibited the best wound healing probability (p-score = 0.90), followed by skin substitutes with living cells (p-score = 0.70), acellular skin substitutes (p-score = 0.56), and advanced topical dressings (p-score = 0.34) compared with standard of care.

,10.1111/j.1742-481x.2006.00271.x,Reimbursement of dressings: a WUWHS statement,International Wound Journal,2006.0,"The treatment of wounds has undergone a technical revolution since the pioneering work on moist wound healing by Winter in 1962. Since that time, a number of different classes of wound dressings and devices have been developed, facilitating patient comfort, optimising local wound management and improving the outcome of care. More complex wounds can be treated earlier, with improved outcomes, as demonstrated by a fall in the rate of amputations associated with diabetic neurotrophic foot ulcers. However, most of modern dressings and devices have not yet brought about a significant level of improvement in wound healing or patient care. The problem arises with regard to the method of approval of dressings and devices in many countries, where statisticians working for country-specific health authorities require evidence from randomised clinical trials. These randomised clinical trials should reflect the efficacy and efficiency of devices while taking into account the multifactorial nature of many chronic wounds and associated comorbidities. Currently, the only gold standard criterion used by health authorities to assess different devices is complete wound healing. However, some countries – influenced by panels of experts – may adopt another strategy for reimbursement, based on what are known as ‘secondary’ criteria or surrogate endpoints. Some of these alternative endpoints are adapted in peer-reviewed published studies and include an improvement in pain or other quality-of-life indicator, an improvement in wound surface debris, a 4-week reduction of at least 30% from baseline in wound size and an increased presence of healthy granulation tissue in the wound base. The World Union of Wound Healing Societies (WUWHS) panel members are advocating for a minimal set of reimbursed devices in all countries worldwide. It is currently acknowledged that reimbursement exists for dressings and devices in a limited number of geographical areas, whereas in other countries, no reimbursement is available or partial coverage may disadvantage outpatients. Education is another important component to improve patient outcomes. Teaching of the basic principles of wound management including evidence-based treatment of the cause and how to manage patient needs should be offered as tools for changing practices. An International Consensus approach was investigated during the first and second WUWHS reimbursement in Paris in 2005 and 2006, leading to this statement. Nurses are increasingly recognised in their own right as professionals in wound healing (e.g. Tissue Viability Nurses in the UK, University Diplomas in France, Wound Ostomy and Continence Nurses in the USA and Enterostomal Therapists in Canada). These specialised nurses usually undertake the holistic care of the patient and have responsibility – along with the physicians (GPs or specialists) – for the general health of the patients, in addition to the prevention and care of wounds. In some countries, these nurses are entitled to prescribe local wound care dressings and other treatments. Nursing services are reimbursed by different health care systems that vary, depending on the country. Reimbursement systems may include the expenses involved when the nurse travels to the patient’s home, but in the majority of countries, the patient has to travel to a wound healing centre (WHC). Regional WHCs are available in the USA, the UK, Denmark and Germany. In other countries, however, where the distance from a patient’s home to the WHC can be an issue, a network of professionals will visit via homecare systems to attend to the patient’s needs. Nurses may be reliant on a health department – part of a city’s organisation (under the authority of the mayor) – and their contribution to a specific task is decided by the administrative authorities (e.g. as in Denmark). This service is free of charge for the patient. In Spain, care centres are distributed throughout a region, and patients are compelled to attend their local centre, although travelling expenses are not always covered. Private health care systems have also been developed. Groups of private insurance companies offer different care packages, including nursing care. A large range of coverage plans are offered, depending on the level of payment. These systems are usually offered by private companies to their employees as part of their professional contract. Risks and coverage are clearly defined on the contract. In general, a broad package covers all diseases and medical conditions, including wounds. The armed services and some national companies (e.g. those responsible for mining, transport and metallurgy) offer this type of package and will, in some cases, have their own physicians, teams of nurses or even entire hospitals. Small companies may establish an association with private or public hospitals. There are other specialised coverage arrangements that may have resulted from political need (e.g. as in Alsace Lorraine after the Second World War). For the patient with no available resources, general hospitals exist virtually everywhere in the world. Wounds are often poorly managed owing to the lack of knowledge and clinical skill in the modern care of wounds and also because of a lack of available funds for wound prevention and treatment, including the cost of supplies and professional expertise. Reimbursement systems surrounding medical devices are poorly developed even in advanced medical systems in the Western world. In most countries, there is no reimbursement of medical devices for outpatients. The devices are paid for by the patient, and the price is fixed according to the market (e.g. Australia, the USA, Singapore, Spain, certain regions of Italy, North Africa, the Middle East and Australia). In other countries, medical devices are not available, as a relevant commercial company is absent or not represented (such as in India and Africa). In the UK, France, Denmark and Germany, the reimbursement of medical devices is partially covered by the general social insurance system, with the remaining cost being paid for by private insurers. The reimbursement is – depending on the Ministry of Health involved – awarded by a commission and is based on the evidence level of the device’s efficacy and its cost. Private pharmacists may apply their own cost margins to the cost of a device; therefore, the total cost for the outpatient can vary from one region to another.

,10.2196/jmir.1672,A Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies,Journal of Medical Internet Research,2011.0,"Background: Many eHealth technologies are not successful in realizing sustainable innovations in health care practices. One of the reasons for this is that the current development of eHealth technology often disregards the interdependencies between technology, human characteristics, and the socioeconomic environment, resulting in technology that has a low impact in health care practices. To overcome the hurdles with eHealth design and implementation, a new, holistic approach to the development of eHealth technologies is needed, one that takes into account the complexity of health care and the rituals and habits of patients and other stakeholders. Objective: The aim of this viewpoint paper is to improve the uptake and impact of eHealth technologies by advocating a holistic approach toward their development and eventual integration in the health sector. Methods: To identify the potential and limitations of current eHealth frameworks (1999–2009), we carried out a literature search in the following electronic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, PiCarta, and Google Scholar. Of the 60 papers that were identified, 44 were selected for full review. We excluded those papers that did not describe hands-on guidelines or quality criteria for the design, implementation, and evaluation of eHealth technologies (28 papers). From the results retrieved, we identified 16 eHealth frameworks that matched the inclusion criteria. The outcomes were used to posit strategies and principles for a holistic approach toward the development of eHealth technologies; these principles underpin our holistic eHealth framework. Results: A total of 16 frameworks qualified for a final analysis, based on their theoretical backgrounds and visions on eHealth, and the strategies and conditions for the research and development of eHealth technologies. Despite their potential, the relationship between the visions on eHealth, proposed strategies, and research methods is obscure, perhaps due to a rather conceptual approach that focuses on the rationale behind the frameworks rather than on practical guidelines. In addition, the Web 2.0 technologies that call for a more stakeholder-driven approach are beyond the scope of current frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we composed a holistic framework based on a participatory development approach, persuasive design techniques, and business modeling. Conclusions: To demonstrate the impact of eHealth technologies more effectively, a fresh way of thinking is required about how technology can be used to innovate health care. It also requires new concepts and instruments to develop and implement technologies in practice. The proposed framework serves as an evidence-based roadmap.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,0.0

There is a global unmet need for tissue repair strategies to treat musculoskeletal (MSK) and spinal disorders, osteoarthritis (OA), and patients with chronic complex and recalcitrant wounds. PRP therapy is based on the fact that platelet growth factors (PGFs) support the three phases of wound healing and repair cascade (inflammation, proliferation, remodeling). Many different PRP formulations have been evaluated, originating from human, in vitro, and animal studies. However, recommendations from in vitro and animal research often lead to different clinical outcomes because it is difficult to translate non-clinical study outcomes and methodology recommendations to human clinical treatment protocols. In recent years, progress has been made in understanding PRP technology and the concepts for bioformulation, and new research directives and new indications have been suggested. In this review, we will discuss recent developments regarding PRP preparation and composition regarding platelet dosing, leukocyte activities concerning innate and adaptive immunomodulation, serotonin (5-HT) effects, and pain killing. Furthermore, we discuss PRP mechanisms related to inflammation and angiogenesis in tissue repair and regenerative processes. Lastly, we will review the effect of certain drugs on PRP activity, and the combination of PRP and rehabilitation protocols.",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,D,Very Low,,general,none,2.0

,10.1098/rstb.2004.1475,Scar–free healing: from embryonic mechanisms to adult therapeutic intervention,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences,2004.0,"In man and domestic animals, scarring in the skin after trauma, surgery, burn or sports injury is a major medical problem, often resulting in adverse aesthetics, loss of function, restriction of tissue movement and/or growth and adverse psychological effects. Current treatments are empirical, unreliable and unpredictable: there are no prescription drugs for the prevention or treatment of dermal scarring. Skin wounds on early mammalian embryos heal perfectly with no scars whereas wounds to adult mammals scar. We investigated the cellular and molecular differences between scar-free healing in embryonic wounds and scar-forming healing in adult wounds. Important differences include the inflammatory response, which in embryonic wounds consists of lower numbers of less differentiated inflammatory cells. This, together with high levels of morphogenetic molecules involved in skin growth and morphogenesis, means that the growth factor profile in a healing embryonic wound is very different from that in an adult wound. Thus, embryonic wounds that heal without a scar have low levels of TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2, low levels of platelet-derived growth factor and high levels of TGFbeta3. We have experimentally manipulated healing adult wounds in mice, rats and pigs to mimic the scar-free embryonic profile, e.g. neutralizing PDGF, neutralizing TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2 or adding exogenous TGFbeta3. These experiments result in scar-free wound healing in the adult. Such experiments have allowed the identification of therapeutic targets to which we have developed novel pharmaceutical molecules, which markedly improve or completely prevent scarring during adult wound healing in experimental animals. Some of these new drugs have successfully completed safety and other studies, such that they have entered human clinical trials with approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities. Initial trials involve application of the drug or placebo in a double-blind randomized design, to experimental incision or punch biopsy wounds under the arms of human volunteers. Based on encouraging results from such human volunteer studies, the lead drugs have now entered human patient-based trials e.g. in skin graft donor sites. We consider the evolutionary context of wound healing, scarring and regeneration. We hypothesize that evolutionary pressures have been exerted on intermediate sized, widespread, dirty wounds with considerable tissue damage e.g. bites, bruises and contusions. Modem wounds (e.g. resulting from trauma or surgery) caused by sharp objects and healing in a clean or sterile environment with close tissue apposition are new occurrences, not previously encountered in nature and to which the evolutionary selected wound healing responses are somewhat inappropriate. We also demonstrate that both repair with scarring and regeneration can occur within the same animal, including man, and indeed within the same tissue, thereby suggesting that they share similar mechanisms and regulators. Consequently, by subtly altering the ratio of growth factors present during adult wound healing, we can induce adult wounds to heal perfectly with no scars, with accelerated healing and with no adverse effects, e.g. on wound strength or wound infection rates. This means that scarring may no longer be an inevitable consequence of modem injury or surgery and that a completely new pharmaceutical approach to the prevention of human scarring is now possible. Scarring after injury occurs in many tissues in addition to the skin. Thus scar-improving drugs could have widespread benefits and prevent complications in several tissues, e.g. prevention of blindness after scarring due to eye injury, facilitation of neuronal reconnections in the central and peripheral nervous system by the elimination of glial scarring, restitution of normal gut and reproductive function by preventing strictures and adhesions after injury to the gastrointestinal or reproductive systems, and restoration of locomotor function by preventing scarring in tendons and ligaments.",OpenAlex,0,0,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,infection,none,6.0

Available clinical studies published in the English language that used human participants and examined glycemic control were included. Data were extracted in a standardized manner, and two independent investigators assessed methodological quality of randomized controlled trials using the Jadad scale.A total of 108 trials examining 36 herbs (single or in combination) and 9 vitamin/mineral supplements, involving 4,565 patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. There were 58 controlled clinical trials involving individuals with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (42 randomized and 16 nonrandomized trials). Most studies involved patients with type 2 diabetes. Heterogeneity and the small number of studies per supplement precluded formal meta-analyses. Of these 58 trials, the direction of the evidence for improved glucose control was positive in 76% (44 of 58). Very few adverse effects were reported.There is still insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of individual herbs and supplements for diabetes; however, they appear to be generally safe. The available data suggest that several supplements may warrant further study. The best evidence for efficacy from adequately designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is available for Coccinia indica and American ginseng.

This progress report provides a critical but detailed insight into the biomedical use of silk. This journey begins with a historical perspective of silk and its uses, including the long‐standing desire to reverse engineer silk. Selected silk structure–function relationships are then examined to appreciate past and current silk challenges. From this, biocompatibility and biodegradation are reviewed with a specific focus of silk performance in humans. The current clinical uses of silk (e.g., sutures, surgical meshes, and fabrics) are discussed, as well as clinical trials (e.g., wound healing, tissue engineering) and emerging biomedical applications of silk across selected formats, such as silk solution, films, scaffolds, electrospun materials, hydrogels, and particles.

There is also a large amount of evidence in the form of case studies that have been reported. It has been shown to give good results on a very wide range of types of wound.

Because platelet activation constitutes a pivotal mechanism for injury in patients with atherosclerosis, we assessed whether early treatment with aspirin could improve survival after coronary bypass surgery.At 70 centers in 17 countries, we prospectively studied 5065 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery, of whom 5022 survived the first 48 hours after surgery. We gathered data on 7500 variables per patient and adjudicated outcomes centrally. The primary focus was to discern the relation between early aspirin use and fatal and nonfatal outcomes.During hospitalization, 164 patients died (3.2 percent), and 812 others (16.0 percent) had nonfatal cardiac, cerebral, renal, or gastrointestinal ischemic complications. Among patients who received aspirin (up to 650 mg) within 48 hours after revascularization, subsequent mortality was 1.3 percent (40 of 2999 patients), as compared with 4.0 percent among those who did not receive aspirin during this period (81 of 2023, P<0.001). Aspirin therapy was associated with a 48 percent reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction (2.8 percent vs. 5.4 percent, P<0.001), a 50 percent reduction in the incidence of stroke (1.3 percent vs. 2.6 percent, P=0.01), a 74 percent reduction in the incidence of renal failure (0.9 percent vs. 3.4 percent, P<0.001), and a 62 percent reduction in the incidence of bowel infarction (0.3 percent vs. 0.8 percent, P=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that no other factor or medication was independently associated with reduced rates of these outcomes and that the risk of hemorrhage, gastritis, infection, or impaired wound healing was not increased with aspirin use (odds ratio for these adverse events, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.74).Early use of aspirin after coronary bypass surgery is safe and is associated with a reduced risk of death and ischemic complications involving the heart, brain, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.",OpenAlex,0,1,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,,,,,B,Moderate,,hemorrhage,infection,8.0

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were once confined largely to hospitals, other health care environments, and patients frequenting these facilities. Since the mid-1990s, however, there has been an explosion in the number of MRSA infections reported in populations lacking risk factors for exposure to the health care system. This increase in the incidence of MRSA infection has been associated with the recognition of new MRSA clones known as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). CA-MRSA strains differ from the older, health care-associated MRSA strains; they infect a different group of patients, they cause different clinical syndromes, they differ in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, they spread rapidly among healthy people in the community, and they frequently cause infections in health care environments as well. This review details what is known about the epidemiology of CA-MRSA strains and the clinical spectrum of infectious syndromes associated with them that ranges from a commensal state to severe, overwhelming infection.

The consequence is a positive fluid balance and weight gain of up to 10 kg, which may be related to severe complications. Because the intravascular blood volume remains unchanged and insensible perspiration is negligible, the fluid must accumulate inside the body. This concept brings into question common liberal infusion regimens. Blood volume after fasting is normal, and a fluid-consuming third space has never been reliably shown. Crystalloids physiologically load the interstitial space, whereas colloidal volume loading deteriorates a vital part of the vascular barrier. The endothelial glycocalyx plays a key role and is destroyed not only by ischemia and surgery, but also by acute hypervolemia. Therefore, undifferentiated fluid handling may increase the shift toward the interstitial space.

Primary prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of febrile neutropenia in patients who are at high risk on the basis of age, medical history, disease characteristics, and myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen. Dose-dense regimens that require CSFs should only be used within an appropriately designed clinical trial or if supported by convincing efficacy data.

,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02498.x,Editorial: The practice and research of complementary and alternative medicine in nursing,Journal of Clinical Nursing,2008.0,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has become increasingly popular in the UK over the past 20 years (Thomas et al. 2001). Up to one in five people in the UK has tried at least one form of CAM, with one in 10 GPs actively involved in providing it and the national health service (NHS) is slowly incorporating more types of CAM and more integrated services are being developed (Thomas et al. 2003). Many nurses practise CAM therapies and most nurses are aware of the fact that such therapies are used by many of their patients for a wide range of conditions. This special edition of JCN is devoted entirely to the subject of CAM. There are several papers in this issue which aim, directly or indirectly, to demonstrate the complexities, problems and challenges of CAM in clinical nursing practice. One of the initial difficulties in compiling this special issue was in relation to what is CAM? It relates to a diverse array of interventions and diagnostic techniques not viewed as part of conventional medicine. The definition of what precisely constitutes CAM appears to differ considerably between countries. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) (2007) defined CAM as ‘a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices and products which are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine’. The World Health Organization defined CAM as ‘a comprehensive term used to refer to both traditional medical systems such as Traditional Chinese medicine, Indian ayurveda and Arabic unami medicine and to various forms of indigenous medicine’ (World Health Organization 2004). One reason for confusion may relate to the lack of clarity over what constitutes CAM. The House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology (2000) classified CAM in the UK into three groups. The first of these groups includes the principal CAM disciplines, described as the ‘big five’. Grouping of CAM therapies on the basis of evidence and level of professional organisation may have several potential applications within the UK; however, its purpose internationally appears limited. The House of Lords Scientific Committee also made recommendations to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and Royal College of Nursing (RCN) to collaborate in making CAM the part of preregistration nursing education and to provide more specific guidance on integrating CAM into clinical nursing care. However, the NMC regulates nurses and midwives, but not complementary therapy practitioners and it is out of their scope to provide specific advice on issues such as training in CAM (Nursing and Midwifery Council 2004). The RCN published a useful framework ‘Complementary therapies in nursing, midwifery and health visiting practice’ which ensures nurses are following their professional code of conduct when integrating CAM into their everyday clinical practice (Royal College of Nursing 2003). Presently, if nurses wish to look for scientific evidence to support the use of a particular CAM therapy they will usually be disappointed to find that very limited evidence base exists. This is partly because, compared with conventional medicine, there has not yet been enough rigorous research to prove the effectiveness of specific treatments, but it is also because there are some difficulties in applying the methods of conventional medical research to CAM treatments. Several reasons have been postulated to explain this dearth of high-quality CAM research including: lack of research training across CAM professions; lack of research funding available for CAM projects; a poor research infrastructure within the CAM sector; and finally many CAM practitioners believing that conventional research methods are not suitable tools to investigate CAM (House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology 2000). Another problem may relate to the reluctance of nurses to apply rigorous research methods to their CAM practice to establish a reliable scientific evidence base. Many nurse CAM therapists are reluctant to conduct research or do not have the appropriate research skills which are required to conduct research on their practice. Others argue that they believe the CAM therapy they provide is safe and effective and does not require scientific scrutiny. Perhaps this, more than any other reason, explains why CAM therapies are viewed as unscientific, unsafe and viewed negatively in certain quarters (O’Mathuna & Larimore 2001). Additionally, many of the published CAM studies that do exist are flawed in nature from a methodological perspective; they suffer from poor design and inappropriate analysis (O’Mathuna 1998). There is also the possibility that even if individual CAM studies do show positive results, meta-analysis may reveal regression to the mean, which is highlighted by Watson (2008) in his editorial critique of homeopathy. It is important that research into all forms of CAM is subject to the same high standards of quality, rigour and ethics as observed in conventional medical research. Because an individual reports symptomatic improvement after using a therapy does not necessarily mean that the intervention caused the improvement. The NCCAM prioritised large and small randomised controlled trial the best form of evidence for determining whether or not an intervention can be attributed to cause observed changes. Uncontrolled trials, observational studies, case studies and anecdotes have limitations in CAM research, principally as they do not control for other changes that could have occurred in an individual’s life. However, the role of good quality qualitative research design in CAM research should not be ignored. Qualitative studies can be stand alone studies and also used in mixed method designs where qualitative data can explain the findings of the RCT and provide in-depth understanding of results from RCT. Qualitative and quantitative methods and researchers can work together in CAM research. The potential for the two approaches informing and enhancing each other is apparent and this is demonstrated by Liu et al. (2008) who reveal the benefit of culturally sensitive body–mind–spirit group in female patients with breast cancer. Their study used multiple methods, including a randomised controlled trial and focus group interview, to reveal reduced anxiety in their study population. Despite being viewed as the ‘gold standard’ in CAM research, there are many methodological difficulties that surround the application",OpenAlex,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,True,,,,,A,High,,general,none,8.0
